abstract = {Ballast fouling and ballast deterioration are significant maintenance concerns. Ballast fouling occurs because of the wearing of the ballast against the tie and other ballast, along with the intrusion of fines from the subgrade and deposition of coal dust or soil particles from the surface. In this study, the assessment of mechanical properties of fouled ballast using available geotechnical tests is discussed. These mechanical properties include subgrade reaction modulus from static plate loading tests, dynamic deformation modulus from light weight deflectometer (LWD) tests, and California bearing ratio (CBR) from dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) tests. The test results show similar trends for these mechanical properties, which were determined by varying the fouling amount as well as the moisture content. The mechanical properties first increased with the moisture content up to a certain value and then decreased rapidly after a peak value. This article also discusses the correlations between these mechanical properties developed from the tests.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the resilient behavior of the interlayer soil which is created mainly by the interpenetration of ballast and subgrade soils. The interlayer soil studied was taken from a site in the southeast of France. Large-scale cyclic triaxial tests were carried out at three water contents (w = 4, 6 and 12 {\%}) and three fines contents corresponding to 5, 10 {\%} subgrade added to the natural interlayer soil and 10 {\%} fine particles ({\textless}80 $\mu$m) removed from the natural interlayer soil. Soil specimens underwent various deviator stresses, and for each deviator stress, a large number of cycles was applied. The effects of deviator stress, number of cycles, water content and fines content on the resilient modulus (Mr) were analyzed. It appears that the effects of water content and fines content must be analyzed together because the two effects are closely linked. Under unsaturated conditions, the soil containing high fines content has higher resilient modulus due to the contribution of suction. When the soil approaches the saturated state, it loses its mechanical enhancement with a sharp decrease in resilient modulus.},

abstract = {The lightweight deflectometer (LWD) is gaining acceptance and popularity as an in situ spot-testing device for quality control/quality assurance of earthwork compaction. Little research has been conducted to investigate the stress-strain response within the soil during LWD testing. Similarly, little research has been performed to examine the appropriateness of using homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic half-space theory to estimate soil modulus (ELWD) from LWD results. With this aim, an array of vertical stress and strain sensors was placed within the soil to measure the stress-strain response during LWD loading. Measured in situ stress values matched well with stresses predicted using homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic half-space theory. In situ stress data revealed that the contact stress distribution between the soil surface and loading plate is a function of the soil type. Measured in situ strain values did not correspond well with strains predicted using homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic elasticity. An exponentially increasing modulus function was required to match experimental with theoretical elastic strains. The results indicate that the commonly used form to predict ELWD is inappropriate if the goal is to extract constitutive soil properties. Analysis of strain data suggests the LWD depth of influence (measurement depth) is 0.9-1.1 times the plate diameter. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

abstract = {A dynamic finite element (FE) model of lightweight deflectometer (LWD) loading on a two-layer soil system, validated with an analytical solution and experimental data, is presented. Peak dynamic FE vertical deflections can be substantially different (almost always smaller) than FE static deflections. The numerically simulated measurement depth of the LWD center sensor is found to be 2–2.5 times the plate diameter, deeper than other experimental studies. Using the FE model, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of peak vertical deflections to the top layer Young's modulus and underlying Young's modulus of two-layer systems. Peak deflections from the center sensor are found to be more sensitive to the top layer Young's modulus while peak deflections at radial offsets are found to be more sensitive to the underlying layer Young's modulus. Sensitivities of layer moduli to FE deflections offer guidance in selecting weighting factors for the inverse solver in an LWD back-calculation procedure.},

abstract = {To ensure safe train services, an effective method is required for the characterization of the strength and stiffness of railway track substructures. In this study, a crosshole-type dynamic cone penetrometer (CDP) is developed to characterize the strength by the crosshole-type dynamic cone penetration index (CDPI) and stiffness by the shear wave velocity (Vs). To verify the Vs obtained using the CDP test, the Vs obtained by both CDP and bender elements are compared in a chamber test. In addition, for the characterization of the railway track substructures, field tests are conducted. The chamber test shows that the Vs obtained using the CDP are almost the same as those obtained by bender elements. In field tests, the CDPI and the Vs are profiled along the depth, the including ballast, sub-ballast, and subgrade layers, which are identified by ground penetrating radar surveys. As the CDPI is highly correlated to the Vs, the stiffness characteristics are considered to be reasonable and can be simply estimated using the CDPI. This study demonstrates that the CDP test can be used for the evaluation of the strength characteristics and small strain elastic properties of the track substructures.},

It is based on the Floquet decomposition which allows the restriction of the analysis for the overall system to a generic cell. The main contribution of the approach presented hereafter is that the response is directly deduced from transfer functions in the space-wavenumber domain calculated in an unbounded generic cell.

abstract = {1.3 Hopkinson type loadings In the 70's in France, G.Aussedat and J.Meunier [10] developped dynamic tests on soils (falling mass with fast filming of the crushing phase). They also performed experiments based on Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar method and well-adapted to soil testing. They designed a low impedance bar (nylon) because their first experiments on steel bars were very disappointing. Using clay specimen, these two experimental arrangements (dynamic crushing and Hopkinson bars) lead them to the following results :  crushing experiments : J.Meunier performed the analysis with fast filming of the tests. This technique allows the study of plastic wave propagation in the specimen during crushing  Hopkinson bars testing : experiments were made on very thin (1 to 10 mm) clay specimens, friction was important because the diameter of the bars is 36 mm. The only transmitted wave was taken into account in these tests, it did not allow the determination of the stress in the specimen (stress in the transmitter bar is less than 2 MPa). G.Aussedat and J.Meunier performed these experiments with and without confining pressure (from 0.2 to 0.6 MPa). From their experiments, amplitude of the transmitted wave was increasing for higher impact speeds or decreasing specimen thicknesses. However, there was no influence of the confining pressure on transmitted wave amplitude. It seems to be logical considering specimen thicknesses and values of confining pressure. Their work is one of the first to investigate dynamic response of soils with an acurate control of transient phenomena in the experimental device itself. Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar tests (SHPB) seem to be well-adapted for soils and allows a good control of wave propagation phenomena. 2. THE "CLASSICAL" S.H.P.B METHOD},

abstract = {Railroad ballast plays an important role in supporting heavy rail loading, preventing the deformation of track, and providing drainage of water from the track structure. However, over time, ballast is fouled by the breakdown of ballast aggregate and/or the infiltration of fines, which undermine ballast functions. This may result in damage to the rail system, such as track settlement. Ground penetrating radar (GPR), a nondestructive method, can be used to rapidly, effectively, and continuously assess railroad track substructure conditions. Ballast under various fouling conditions generates various electromagnetic (EM) scattering patterns. In this study, air-coupled 2 GHz antenna was found to be sensitive to the scattering pattern change. Appropriate data processing was used to remove the effects of ties and rails to obtain clear GPR images of the subsurface layers. Then, the amplitude envelope and time-frequency approaches were implemented to characterize the signal in time and frequency domains simultaneously. Using these techniques, non-fouled ballast thickness can be assessed and trapped water can be detected, along the track.},

In order to study the effect of diameter ratio, three different sizes of container (210mm, 420mm and 850mm diameter) were used. The repeatability of the model preparation technique using a single hole hopper was checked prior to these tests. Side boundary and base boundary effects are found to be significant and a minimum diameter ratio is proposed for tests to be carried out using a circular container. The effect of the relative density of Fontainbleau sand is studied. The possibility of simulating an infinite body of sand is also mentioned. It has also been demonstrated that the relative density of sand can be correlated with the normalised tip resistance},

abstract = {To reduce railway track maintenance costs and meet the growing demand for rail travel the railway industry needs to significantly increase the performance of old existing tracks and design any new tracks accordingly. In this thesis, a new full-scale laboratory Geopavement {\&} Railway Accelerated Fatigue Testing (GRAFT) facility at Heriot-Watt University is developed to study the performance of both unreinforced and reinforced railway track substructure systems. The new GRAFT facility enables accelerated testing of full-scale railway tracks and innovative railway products under realistic railway loading conditions. The unreinforced track systems represent typical railway tracks in the UK while the reinforced track systems represent sections of track implemented with various geosynthetic products. GRAFT consists of a track constructed within a steel tank. The track comprises a 750mm clay subgrade layer overlain by a clay formation layer overlain by a 300mm ballast layer. The track includes three hardwood sleeper sections overlain by an I-section steel beam which has similar stiffness properties to a BS 113 A rail section. Cyclic loading is applied to the track from a hydraulic testing machine with the centre sleeper directly under the loading actuator. The loading mechanism replicates a repeated quasi static single wheel load on the central sleeper of one half of a 3m long section of railway track. Based on the results found from the testing programme in GRAFT empirical relationships are developed between the unreinforced track performance in terms of track settlement and stiffness and the subgrade modulus, applied load and number of applied cycles. These relationships fit the GRAFT data presented in this thesis well and it is thought that they could be used (tentatively) to estimate track settlement on track after tamping/ballast renewal/new track. These relationships are shown to be consistent with other well known track settlement models and they indicate that subgrade stiffness and applied vertical load are two of the most significant parameters that influence track substructure deterioration. The results found from the reinforced track tests quantify the improvement in track performance available with each product under various track conditions. Two ballast ii reinforcement products have been tested; XiTRACK reinforcement and geocell reinforcement, along with a reinforced geocomposite used primarily for separation at the ballast/subgrade interface. In addition, a geocomposite product designed to replace a traditional sand blanket, used on the tracks where severe subgrade erosion conditions prevail, has been tested in GRAFT under flooding conditions. The most significant results show that XiTRACK reinforcement can considerably improve the performance of railway tracks while the performance of the track implemented with the sand blanket replacement product indicates that currently a traditional sand blanket with a geotextile separator is the recommended option for tracks with subgrade wet spots. From all the data recorded empirical settlement models are proposed for each of the geosynthetics compared for reinforcement purposes. These models form the basis for reinforced track design graphs that could potentially be used to form part of an initial cost-benefit analysis of different track reinforcement techniques considered for improving track performance and reducing maintenance. In order to use the track settlement design graphs developed within this thesis (in the field) a reliable measure of subgrade stiffness needs to be made on track. A reliable insitu measuring device could enhance railway site investigations. Several in-situ measuring devices that could potentially be used to measures subgrade stiffness and strength in the field have been tested within GRAFT. The devices studied include the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP), Light Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD), Pocket Penetrometer and Proving Ring Penetrometer. The accuracy of these devices is compared to Plate Load Tests (PLT) and unconfined compression strength tests and suggestions towards the use of such devices on track made. The results indicate that the DCP has the potential to be a quick and accurate in-situ measuring device for railway track site investigations. The GRAFT facility and the results found in GRAFT have been validated using a basic static 3D FE computer model termed SART3D (Static Analysis of Railway Track 3D). The program has been calibrated to GRAFT by modifying the FE mesh for the dimensions of GRAFT and inputting the GRAFT track properties. The validated results from this thesis have direct practical implications to the railway industry in terms of iii design recommendations on how best to investigate and improve key geotechnical parameters that influence railway track performance and hence reduce maintenance costs and extend asset life. A review of current design procedures used in the railway industry is given and a new design procedure is suggested to reduce track maintenance and offer an optimised design and maintenance strategy.},

However there are some points of weakness that have been poorly investigated in the past. One of them is the definition of the domain of influence of the deflectometer for various test setups and different soils. This paper proposes a new model based on the Boussinesq theory that has been calibrated using the outcome of experimental tests. The series of laboratory and field scale investigations that are presented here are not conventional. In particular the actual deep deflections have been measured under the surface using an original experiments setup. Using the calibrated model, it is also suggested that a revised version of the corrected Boussinesq equation be used to better represent stress distribution in soil, where a second parameter is included along with the so called Froehlich concentration factor. {\textcopyright} 2011 ISTVS.

abstract = {This article presents an overview (requirements) of rail track aggregates, the ballast gradation adopted in railways in different countries and their comparison with Indian ballast gradation, drainage of rail track and ballast fouling in India. Further in situ ballast sampling, testing and ballast fouling quantification are also presented for typical track ballast. Ten ballast samples were collected from in and around Bangalore, India and fouling values were estimated as per international procedures followed for determining the fouling indices. Results show that fouling values of station tracks increase with time. Non coal/ore transport tracks and track on firm sub grade experience moderate fouling due to the break down of ballast and naturally occurring materials like dust, dirt, soil, etc. Fouling indices are specific to fouling materials and gradations. In this study it was found that the existing fouling indices are unable to reflect the representative fouling values for Indian railway ballast studied, hence alternate fouling indices are suggested for Indian railway ballast gradation. The article also presents an overview of the recent advancements in the identification of subsurface rail track problems using geophysical methods and conventional track monitoring and cleaning. The Indian railway follows coarser ballast gradation and conventional procedure to identify the rail track subsurface problems. Many advanced methods need to be experimented in Indian rail tracks to modernize the railway track foundations for the fast transportation of goods and passengers. {\textcopyright} 2012 Indian Geotechnical Society.},

abstract = {The calibration chamber tests are made in order to develop some correlations between cone penetration resistance, vertical (or horizontal) stress and relative density of the sand to be used in soil investigation. They are performed in the chamber of limited dimensions with the possibility to control both the vertical and horizontal stress and strain applied to the cylindrical soil sample. The results of penetration tests in calibration chamber are influenced by the applied boundary conditions and size effect defined as a function of the diameter of the chamber to the diameter of the probe. The effect of boundary conditions (BC) and chamber size depends on the material tested: sand granulometry, mineralogy and the form of grains. The tests were made on a quartz uniform fine sand from the Baltic beach in Lubiatowo. To estimate the influence of boundary conditions the cones of different diameter from 13.4 mm to 36 mm and dilatometer test were used. The mini-probe 13.4 mm in diameter permits to make tests with a small influence of boundary conditions, especially for loose sand. All tests were carried out for boundary conditions BC1 which give lower estimation of the cone resistance. The tests were made for two densities D R = 0.5 and D R = 0.8 to study the influence of density and stress level on the cone resistance. The analysis permitted to propose the correction coefficients which take into consideration the influence of boundary conditions and size effect on the cone resistance measured in Lubiatowo sand in the calibration chamber in GUT.},

abstract = {Longitudinal joints in asphalt pavements typically have lower densities than the interior portion of the mat. Therefore, they tend to exhibit surface distresses such as cracking and raveling more rapidly. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of nondestructive testing (NDT) for assessing the relative condition of a longitudinal joint. NDT has been significantly developed for pavement evaluation during the past decade. Deflection and surface wave methods are the most commonly used for pavement evaluation. The portable falling weight deflectometer (PFWD) is increasingly used in quality control and quality assurance to provide rapid determination of the equivalent surface elastic modulus. However, the multichannel analysis of the surface waves (MASW) method consists of using ultrasonic transducers to measure surface waves traveling through the pavement and invert for the elastic modulus of different layers. This study presents results from both deflection and seismic methods to assess the quality of longitudinal joints. Both methods are performed at the same locations of the centerline of a test track. Pavement deflection is also measured on the wheelpath for comparison with previous data. Across the joint, changes smaller than 7{\%} were observed in deflection values. These preliminary results cannot be directly related to joint quality because the contribution of sublayers to the modulus measured with the PFWD needs to be estimated. MASW measurements showed promising results for evaluating the attenuation of surface waves due to the joint. Further work is required to improve the coupling between the transducers and asphalt surface.},

Two techniques were employed to obtain penetration time histories, including photonic Doppler velocimetry for high velocity impact tests, and high speed imaging for low velocity impact tests. Penetration time histories were differentiated to obtain velocity and acceleration time histories. Analysis of the time histories revealed that the role of nose shape, packing density, and saturation is material dependent. Silica sands and calcareous sands showed contrasting behavior across the parameter space considered. These observations point to the significance of particle crushing in rapid penetration into granular media.},

abstract = {In the conventional French railway substructures, a layer namely interlayer was created naturally by the interpenetration of ballast and subgrade. The lower part of this interlayer is characterized by a matrix of fines with inclusion of coarse grains in it. Moreover, the coarse-grain content is decreasing over depth. In this study, the effect of volumetric content of coarse grains fv (volumetric ratio of coarse grains to the whole sample; grain size {\textgreater} 2 mm) on the mechanical behavior of the lower part interlayer soil was investigated by carrying out monotonic triaxial tests. The results showed that increasing the volumetric content of coarse grains fv led to more significant dilatancy. The shear strength also increased with the increase of fv and the increasing trend appeared to be much more significant when fv {\textgreater}20{\%}. Examination of the variations of peak deviator stress with fv revealed the existence of a characteristic value of fv-cha ≈ 27{\%} that separates two zones with different coarse-grain effects: a fine-fine contact dominating zone when fv ≤ 27{\%} and a grain-grain contact dominating zone when fv {\textgreater} 27{\%}. To clarify the observed phenomena, X-ray microcomputed tomography ($\mu$CT) scans were performed on the as-compacted samples, allowing the coarse-grain distribution inside the as-compacted sample to be visualized. It was found that when fv ranged from 0{\%} to 10{\%}, the skeleton of the sample was mainly constituted by fines with the coarse grains floating in the fines matrix. By contrast, when fv reached 20{\%}, the coarse grains formed some aggregates but the fine-fine contacts were still dominating. When fv increased up to 35{\%}–45{\%}, the skeleton of the sample turned to be dominated by the coarse grains. This suggests that the characteristic volumetric content of coarse grains identified through monotonic triaxial test results corresponds to the transition of soil fabric from fine-fine contacts to grain-grain contacts.},

abstract = {Dynamic penetrometer tests are widely used in geotechnical studies for soils characterization but their implementation tends to be difficult. The light penetrometer test is able to give information about a cone resistance useful in the field of geotechnics and recently validated as a parameter for the case of coarse granular materials. In order to characterize directly the railway ballast on track and sublayers of ballast, a huge test campaign has been carried out for more than 5 years in order to build up a database composed of 19,000 penetration tests including endoscopic video record on the French railway network. The main objective of this work is to give a first statistical analysis of cone resistance in the coarse granular layer which represents a major component of railway track: the ballast. The results show that the cone resistance (qd) increases with depth and presents strong variations corresponding to layers of different natures identified using the endoscopic records. In the first zone corresponding to the top 30cm, (qd) increases linearly with a slope of around 1MPa/cm for fresh ballast and fouled ballast. In the second zone below 30cm deep, (qd) increases more slowly with a slope of around 0,3MPa/cm and decreases below 50cm. These results show that there is no clear difference between fresh and fouled ballast. Hence, the (qd) sensitivity is important and increases with depth. The (qd) distribution for a set of tests does not follow a normal distribution. In the upper 30cm layer of ballast of track, data statistical treatment shows that train load and speed do not have any significant impact on the (qd) distribution for clean ballast; they increase by 50{\%} the average value of (qd) for fouled ballast and increase the thickness as well. Below the 30cm upper layer, train load and speed have a clear impact on the (qd) distribution.},

abstract = {In the ancient railway sub-structure in France, after years of operation, the inter-penetration of fine particles of sub-grade and ballast has created a new layer referred to as the interlayer. As it was naturally formed, the fines content and water content of the interlayer vary considerably. In this study, the effects of the fines and water contents on the mechanical behavior of interlayer soil were investigated by carrying out large-scale monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests. The results of the monotonic triaxial tests show that adding more fines in the interlayer soil does not significantly change the shear strength in the dry condition (water content w=4{\%} and 6{\%}), but drastically decreases the shear strength parameters (friction angle and cohesion) in the nearly saturated condition (w=12{\%}). The cyclic triaxial tests were performed at various deviator stress levels. By considering the permanent axial strain at the end of application of each stress level, it was found that the higher the fines content in the nearly saturated condition (w=12{\%}), the larger the permanent axial strain. In the case of lower water content (w=4{\%} and 6{\%}), the opposite trend was identified: adding fines decreases the permanent axial strain. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.},

However, if the use of the elasto-static model based on the Boussinesq's theory does not constitute a shortcoming in the back-calculation procedure of homogenous elastic modulus, questions have been arose about the reliability and accuracy of the peak value method commonly used to extract the static stiffness of soils and subgrade from the dynamic transient data. This paper deals with the use of minimization technique, based on least square algorithm as an alternative method for data analysis and soil elastic stiffness identification. Details of the mathematical basis, the implementation and different steps for elastic modulus back calculation, are presented. In this method, an equivalent spring-mass-dashpot system, where the complex dynamic soil behavior is reduced to a viscoelastic one-dimensional wave propagation problem, is used for modeling the loading plate/soil system. The comparative study shows the suitability and the accuracy of the minimization method for soil elastic stiffness identification and elastic modulus back calculation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Usage des modules de d{\'{e}}formation en g{\'{e}}otechnique Pr{\'{e}}sentation L'article d'OlMer Combarieu sur les modules en g{\'{e}}otechnique pr{\'{e}}sente l'int{\'{e}}r{\^{e}}t de traiter d'un sujet difficile, mais {\^{o}} combien n{\'{e}}cessaire dans la pratique puisqu'il est de plus en plus demand{\'{e}} de calculer les ouvrages g{\'{e}}otechniques en d{\'{e}}formation, c'est-{\`{a}}-dire d'en pr{\'{e}}voir tous les principaux d{\'{e}}placements en donnant mieux qu'un ordre de grandeur. Sujet difficile car chacun sait que le comportement d'un sol est complexe et fort loin de l'{\'{e}}lasticit{\'{e}} lin{\'{e}}aire qui est {\`{a}} la base de la r{\'{e}}sistance des mat{\'{e}}riaux. En effet, nonlin{\'{e}}arit{\'{e}}, non-r{\'{e}}versibilit{\'{e}}, dilatance, effet du temps, anisotropie sont autant de caract{\'{e}}ristiques du comportement du squelette des sols, auquel il faut adjoindre le couplage avec la pression interstitielle pour les sols fins satur{\'{e}}s. Sujet n{\'{e}}cessaire car, devant cette complexit{\'{e}}, il convient d'avoir une approche pragmatique et r{\'{e}}a-liste pour dimensionner les ouvrages g{\'{e}}otechniques. Apr{\`{e}}s le d{\'{e}}veloppement de mod{\`{e}}les de comportement g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ral du sol comportant un grand nombre de param{\`{e}}tres et qui s'est heurt{\'{e}} au probl{\`{e}}me de leur d{\'{e}}termination et de leut mesure, ce sont maintenant des mod{\`{e}}les plus simples, souvent de type {\'{e}}lastoplastique, voire m{\^{e}}me {\'{e}}lastique, qui sont utilis{\'{e}}s, mais dans lesquels le module de d{\'{e}}formation pris en compte est adapt{\'{e}} au type de sollicitation propre {\`{a}} l'ouwage consid{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}. Ainsi, pour un sol donn{\'{e}}, il n'y a pas un seul module, mais un grand nombre de moduies. Reste {\`{a}} choisir celui qui est le plus appropri{\'{e}} et pour ce faire, les retours d'exp{\'{e}}rience et les r{\'{e}}sultats d'instrumentations sont d'une importance capitale. Olivier Combarieu a pass{\'{e}} toute sa carri{\`{e}}re de g{\'{e}}otechnicien au laboratoire r{\'{e}}gional des Ponts et Chauss{\'{e}}es de Rouen du CETE de Normandie Centre. Il nous liwe ici son exp{\'{e}}rience, riche d'une grande diversit{\'{e}} d'ouwages dimensionn{\'{e}}s et de nombreuses recherches effectu{\'{e}}es, {\`{a}} propos notamment du pressiom{\`{e}}tre dont il faut rappeler qu'il est le seul essai rn situ courant qui donne un module de d{\'{e}}for-mation du sol. Apr{\`{e}}s avoir indiqu{\'{e}} les diff{\'{e}}rents modules que l'on peut tirer de l'essai pressiom{\'{e}}trique, il pr{\'{e}}sente une analyse critique et argument{\'{e}}e de leur utilisation possible dans deux domaines o{\`{u}} le choix du module de d{\'{e}}formation est capital: les tassements des fondations superficielles, puis les d{\'{e}}pla-cements lat{\'{e}}raux des parois souples et des pieux. Ses connaissances pratiques approfondies lui per-mettent d'apporter sur certains points un {\'{e}}clairage neuf, de bien montrer la compl{\'{e}}mentarit{\'{e}} existant entre essai aedom{\'{e}}trique et essai pressiom{\'{e}}trique; elles l'am{\`{e}}nent m{\^{e}}me {\`{a}} r{\'{e}}futer certaines pratiques erron{\'{e}}es pour recommander des m{\'{e}}thodes plus adapt{\'{e}}es, particuli{\`{e}}rement pour les charges de tr{\`{e}}s grandes dimensions sur sols compressibles. L'article ne comporte ni de longs calculs, ni de grandes th{\'{e}}ories. Nul doute qu'il sera appr{\'{e}}ci{\'{e}} de tous ceux qui, de pr{\`{e}}s ou de loin, s'int{\'{e}}ressent au calcul en d{\'{e}}formation des ouwages g{\'{e}}otechniques. l.Sl IE l= I rrl l.Ol l{\'{E}} Fran{\c{c}}ois SCHLOSSER L'auteur examine en d{\'{e}}tail la notion de module et l'usage qui en est fait dans le g{\'{e}}nie civil et tout particuli{\`{e}}rement en g{\'{e}}otechnique. Apr{\`{e}}s un rappel {\'{e}}l{\'{e}}mentaire du comportement {\'{e}}lastique et des essais initiaux en ayant permis l'{\'{e}}tude, la r{\'{e}}alit{\'{e}} du comportement est d{\'{e}}crite dans les deux domaines: celui du cisaillement (ou d{\'{e}}viatorique), et celui de la compression (ou sph{\'{e}}rique) dans les conditions de drainage ou non-drainage du sol. Les diff{\'{e}}rents essais d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}}s pour caract{\'{e}}riser les massifs sont d{\'{e}}crits, de m{\^{e}}me que les liens existant entre les divers param{\`{e}}tres de d{\'{e}}formation en r{\'{e}}sultant. Trois tylres de probl{\`{e}}mes tr{\`{e}}s courants sont ensuite expos{\'{e}}s, arrxquels l'auteur a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} confront{\'{e}}. 1) Tout d'abord, celui des tassements verticaux sous fondations superficielles et sous charge de tr{\`{e}}s grande dimension. Est r{\'{e}}affirm{\'{e}}e la pertinence, pour les sols peu compressibles, de l'approche pressiom{\'{e}}trique pour les fondations superficielles de dimensions transversales mod{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}es, de m{\^{e}}me que celle d'une approche {\'{e}}lastique {\`{a}} partir du module cyclique issu de l'essai pressiom{\'{e}}trique. Il est propos{\'{e}} un facteur correctif, non valid{\'{e}}, dans I'approche {\'{e}}lastique lorsque les dimensions, {\`{a}} la fois transversale et longitudinale, deviennent importantes. 2) Puis, celui des tassements des sols compressibles sous charges de tr{\`{e}}s grande {\'{e}}tendue o{\`{u}} l'approche pressiom{\'{e}}trique s'av{\`{e}}re inadapt{\'{e}}e et optimiste, ainsi que source possible d'erreurs graves, m{\^{e}}me si l'on propose d'en am{\'{e}}liorer la formulation.

abstract = {In French conventional railway track-bed, an interlayer was created, mainly from the interpenetration of ballast and subgrade. Field investigation showed that the ballast content decreases over depth. In addition, depending on the locations, the grain size distribution of ballast grains can be quite different, defining different values of coefficient of uniformity, Cu. In this study, triaxial tests were carried out on the interlayer soil with three Cu values and five volumetric inclusion contents, fv. X-ray micro computed tomography scans were also conducted on representative samples to visualise the corresponding inclusion distributions. Results show that: (a) at all three Cu values, two soil fabrics can be identified, namely grain–grain contact structure for large inclusion contents (fv = 35{\%} and 45{\%}) and fine–fine contact structure for small inclusion contents (fv = 5{\%}, 10{\%} and 20{\%}), and the characteristic volumetric inclusion content fv-cha separating these two categories was larger for smaller Cu since in this case fewer inclusion contacts were expected to be developed at a given fv; (b) for the grain–grain contact structure, a smaller Cu caused larger maximum deviator stress qmax, larger friction angle, larger Poisson ratio and more dilatancy due to the involvement of more large grains at smaller Cu; (c) for the fine–fine contact structure, an opposite trend was observed: the smaller the Cu, the smaller the qmax, the friction angle, the Poisson ratio and the dilatancy owing to a smaller quantity of inclusion grains; (d) the change patterns of Young's modulus and cohesion with increasing Cu were the same for the two soil fabrics – Young's modulus and cohesion decreased with the increase of Cu},

abstract = {The lightweight deflectometer (LWD) is gaining acceptance and popularity as an in situ spot-testing device for quality control/quality assurance of earthwork compaction. Little research has been conducted to investigate the stress-strain response within the soil during LWD testing. Similarly, little research has been performed to examine the appropriateness of using homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic half-space theory to estimate soil modulus (ELWD) from LWD results. With this aim, an array of vertical stress and strain sensors was placed within the soil to measure the stress-strain response during LWD loading. Measured in situ stress values matched well with stresses predicted using homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic half-space theory. In situ stress data revealed that the contact stress distribution between the soil surface and loading plate is a function of the soil type. Measured in situ strain values did not correspond well with strains predicted using homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic elasticity. An exponentially increasing modulus function was required to match experimental with theoretical elastic strains. The results indicate that the commonly used form to predict ELWD is inappropriate if the goal is to extract constitutive soil properties. Analysis of strain data suggests the LWD depth of influence (measurement depth) is 0.9-1.1 times the plate diameter. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

abstract = {This paper examines the feasibility and limitations of Forward Looking Infrared Radiometer (FLIR) Aerial Technology for detecting fouled ballast. The method is intended to provide an efficient and ready-to-use approach that can help the railroads detect fouled ballast in their early stages. Ballast fouling commonly occurs as a result of fine particles clogging off water passage through them. Subsequently, this results in trapped water that often results in poor foundation strength, rotting of the ties, and other ill effects. This study includes a novel approach to evaluate the railway ballast fouling by using thermal imaging techniques. In particular, the thermal characteristics of clean and fouled ballast are studied using FLIR cameras that can be used onboard rolling stock, Hyrail trucks, or drones. Laboratory tests are primarily performed to measure the surface temperature changing rate of clean and fouled ballast in response to ambient temperature changes. For the purpose of laboratory testing, the camera is set up in stationary and moving configurations. The test results indicate that clean and fouled ballast have different thermal characteristics. In particular, different thermal patterns are obtained during naturally-occurring daily temperature change. The test results also indicate that the FLIR cameras can be used on a moving platform for quick scanning of thermal images of the ballast that could be used for assessing the early stage of fouling.},

abstract = {This mini-review provides a brief overview of recent devices that use networks of elastomeric valves to minimize or eliminate the need for interconnections between microfluidic chips and external instruction lines that send flow control signals. Conventional microfluidic control mechanisms convey instruction signals in a parallel manner such that the number of instruction lines must increase as the number of independently operated valves increases. The devices described here circumvent this "tyranny of microfluidic interconnects" by the serial encoding of information to enable instruction of an arbitrary number of independent valves with a set number of control lines, or by the microfluidic circuit-embedded encoding of instructions to eliminate control lines altogether. Because the parallel instruction chips are the most historical and straightforward to design, they are still the most commonly used approach today. As requirements for instruction complexity, chip-to-chip communication, and real-time on-chip feedback flow control arise, the next generation of integrated microfluidic circuits will need to incorporate these latest interconnect flow control approaches.},

An assessment is made of the effects of chamber size on the measured values of the limit pressure obtained from the pressuremeter test and on the cone resistance values from the cone penetrometer test.

Following a brief outline of the historical developments in the field, the concepts associated with the definition, physical interpretation and use of the dynamic impedance functions of foundations are elucidated and the available analytical/numerical methods for their evaluation are discussed. Groups of crucial dimensionless problem parameters related to the soil profile and the foundation geometry are identified and their effects on the response are studied. Results are presented in the form of simple formulae and dimensionless graphs for both the static and dynamic parts of impedances, pertaining to surface and embedded foundations having circular, strip, rectangular or arbitrary plan shape and supported by three types of idealized soil profiles: the halfspace, the stratum-over-bedrock and the layer-over-halfspace. Consideration is given to the effects of inhomogeneity, anisotropy and non-linearity of soil. The various results are synthesized in a case study referring to the response of two rigid massive foundations, and practical recommendations are made on how to inexpensively predict the response of foundations supported by actual soil deposits. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {The quality and support of the subgrade portion of a railroad trackbed are vital to the overall performance of the track structure. The subgrade is an integral component of the track structure and its performance properties must be considered in order to effectively assess its influence on subsequent track quality. European and Asian railways are particularly advanced in implementing subgrade performance indicators into their track designs and assessments. As train speed and tonnage increase in the U.S., the evaluation and influence of subgrade performance will become even more paramount. There are numerous means of measuring and predicting subgrade performance. Both laboratory and in-situ test methods have been used. A review of available testing methods is presented herein in the context of railroad subgrade assessment. Discussion on the applicability of each test to the American railroad industry is also included. In-situ tests likely provide the greater advantage in railway engineering because results can typically be obtained quickly, more cost effectively, and with a larger data set. Newer rail-bound, continuous testing devices, while not testing the subgrade directly, are extremely convenient and will likely become more common in the future.},

abstract = {the Japanese Geotechnical Society, 4-38-2, Sengoku, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112-0011, Japan. Upon request the closing date may be extended one month. ABSTRACT Measurement of the settlement of a cone submitted to incremental loading allows the determination of a modulus correlated to those obtained using laboratory tests or derived from other in situ tests. This test can be carried out with standard static penetrometer equipment. After stopping the penetration of a static penetrometer cone at a selected depth, an incremental loading test is carried out until the failure of the ground under the cone is observed. Stress strain relationships can be drawn from cone resistance and sleeve friction. In this manner, a modulus and a friction angle can be obtained. Thus the classical CPT log is enriched o{\v{S}}ering new possibilities. In this paper the development of th{\^{e}}rst prototype and measuring devices and the proposed testing procedure are presented. A comparison of laboratory aneld tests and geotechnical centrifuge models shows the validity of the testing procedure and the chosen interpretation method. The results of site investigations carried out on French national experimental sites are also discussed and com-pared with high quality borehole expansion test aneld measurement of shear wave velocity. These investigations have been carried out using this new testing method in combination with a semi-heavy static Piezocone penetrometer in order to check the potential use for geotechnical design. An attempt is made in this paper to validate the interpretation method of the results, which can be used for routine geotechnical engineering.},

Emphasis is on analytical solutions, often including the full derivation of the solution, and giving the main parts of computer programs that can be used to calculate numerical data. Reference is also made to a website from which complete computer programs can be downloaded. Soil behaviour is usually assumed to be linear elastic, but in many cases the effect of viscous damping or hysteretic damping, due to plastic deformations, is also considered. Special features are: the analysis of wave propagation in saturated compressible porous media, approximate analysis of the generation of Rayleigh waves, the analysis of the response of soil layers to earthquakes in the deep rock, with a theoretical foundation of such problems by the propagation of Love waves, and the solution of such basic problems as the response of an elastic half space to point loads, line loads, strip loads and moving loads. - Includes detailed derivations of solutions - Includes listings of main parts of computer programs - Computer programs are available from the website http://geo.verruijt.net - Includes dynamics of porous media Audience: Students and staff in soil dynamics at civil engineering, geophysics and earthquake engineering departments.},

abstract = {The lightweight deflectometer (LWD) is a portable device that measures surface deflections and applied force, from which dynamic stiffness and elastic modulus can be estimated. The inclusion of radial offset sensors with LWD testing, referred to here as multiple sensor LWD testing, stemmed from the well-established falling weight deflectometer (FWD) testing method. However, little research exists in the literature addressing LWD use on stabilized or lightly bound layers with multiple sensors, or exploring the applicability of backcalculating/isolating layer moduli from multiple sensor LWD tests. To this end, over 200 multiple sensor LWD tests on stabilized base materials were performed at five sites and rigorously analyzed to determine if the test could capture growth in stabilized base stiffness while the underlying subgrade layer remained unchanged. Deflection results demonstrate that the LWD test is capable of detecting changes in the stiffness of the stabilized base material during curing as illustrated by the decreasing magnitude in center deflections. Furthermore, radial offset deflections measuring 60 cm from the plate center remained constant during curing, providing valuable information about the subgrade support. The findings made directly from the deflections were confirmed via an analytical backcalculation using Boussinesq's equations and Odemark's method of equivalent thickness. The use of multiple sensor LWD testing allows for a richer interpretation of earthwork behavior than the traditional center deflection LWD results.},

abstract = {Specification target values for granular materials and fine grained soils are proposed. For granular material, the grading number and field moisture content are used to select the dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) and light weight deflectometer (LWD) target values. A sieve analysis is used to determine the grading number and an oven dry test to determine the field moisture content. For compacted fine grained soil, the plastic limit and field moisture content are used to determine the target values. The plastic limit is used to classify the soil and to estimate the optimum moisture content for compaction. This report also provides further standardization of the LWD and DCP testing procedures and recommends three seating drops to ensure greater uniformity during testing. The DCP and LWD estimate the strength and modulus of compacted materials. More specifically, they measure the penetration and deflection. When measuring penetration and deflection, the moisture content remains a critical quality control parameter for all compaction operations. Therefore, the moisture content needs to be measured, or estimated confidently, at each location. The LWD and DCP are performance related construction quality assurance tests that are expected to: increase compaction uniformity, lower life cycle pavement costs, increase inspector presence at the construction site, improve documentation, and increase inspector safety and productivity.},

abstract = {Ballast plays a vital role in transmitting and distributing train wheel loads to the underlying sub-ballast and subgrade. Bearing capacity of track, train speed, riding quality and passenger comfort all depend on the stability of ballast through mechanical interlocking of particles. Ballast attrition and breakage occur progressively under heavy cyclic loading, causing track deterioration and rail misalignment-affecting safety and demanding frequent and costly track maintenance. In the absence of realistic constitutive models, the track substructure is traditionally designed using empirical approaches. In Advanced Rail Geotechnology: Ballasted Track, the authors present detailed information on the strength, deformation and degradation, and aspects of fresh and recycled ballast under monotonic, cyclic, and impact loading using innovative geotechnical testing devices. The book presents a new stress-strain constitutive model for ballast incorporating particle breakage and validates mathematical formulations and numerical models using experimental evidence and field trials. The text also elucidates the effectiveness of various commercially available geosynthetics for enhancing track drainage and stability. It presents revised ballast gradations for modern high-speed trains capturing particle breakage and describes the use of geosynthetics in track design. It also provides insight into track design, capturing particle degradation, fouling, and drainage. This book is ideal for final year civil engineering students and postgraduates and is a solid reference for practicing railway engineers and researchers with the task of modernizing existing track designs for heavier and faster trains.},

abstract = {Despite the availability of reliable stiffness-based quality control evaluation techniques, developing countries still adopt traditional density-based quality control assessment on unbound pavement layers. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of light-weight deflectometers (LWD) as a quality control device for modified subgrade under varying drop weights. Experimental investigations were performed on a 240-m long and 9-m wide experimental stretch constructed in Gujarat, India. Mean target stiffness value on the modified subgrade using LWD with 10, 15, and 20-kg drop weights were 40, 51, and 64 MPa, respectively. Percentage variations between target and evaluated stiffness values on the modified subgrade were 2.60, 3.10, and 0.28{\%}, for 10, 15, and 20-kg drop weights, respectively. Subsequently, the influence of in situ moisture content and density on stiffness values of modified subgrade for various drop weights was assessed by correlation analysis, and the results depict a good R 2 value from 0.74 to 0.82. The LWD backcalculated moduli (10 kg) and dynamic cone penetrometer estimated resilient moduli values of modified subgrade were compared, and the mean percentage variation was 3.78–4.95{\%}. Thus, there is a substantiate relationship between in situ density and stiffness values that follow similar trends under varying LWD drop weights. Therefore, LWD stiffness-based evaluation on modified subgrade soil contributes to enhancing the effectiveness of quality control measures during construction of low volume roads.},

abstract = {The characterisation of track substructure is an integral component of track maintenance and rehabilitation. Traditionally this is done by determining the geotechnical properties of the discrete track formation layers by excavating test pits and sampling the substructure layers. The development of geophysical investigation techniques such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR) allows continuous assessment of the condition of the track substructure. The research described in this paper uses GPR to develop a track substructure characterisation model and provides classifications for both the ballast and formation layers. The ballast and formation were classified into four classes, namely very good, good, moderate and poor. When applying the model to two sections of track (with generally good and poor quality) 82{\%} and 100{\%} of classes had only one class difference compared to the traditional characterisation tests for the formation and ballast layers respectively. The GPR track substructure characterisation model that was developed therefore compares well with traditional characterisation techniques and will result in significant cost and time reduction. The characterisation of the track using GPR provides a continuous classification and enhances the accuracy of the data on which a maintenance engineer can base decisions.},

abstract = {The measurement.of soil properties in-situ offers the advantages of minimal disturbance, retention of the in-situ state of stress, temperature, chemical and biological environments, and cost effectiveness relative to many types of laboratory tests for evaluation of undisturbed soil properties. This report is concerned with techniques for in-situ measurement of permeability, strength, stress-deformation properties, and volume change properties; property classes which are of interest in most geo-technical ,engineeringproblems. Emphasis is on test concepts, data analysis and interpretation, and advantages and limitations of methods, as opposed to details of apparatus and procedure. Permeability (hydraulic conductivity) is often measured in-situ by means of inflow or outflow borehole pumping tests employing either,constant or falling heads. Large scale pumping tests provide the most accurate results, but their high cost generally restricts their use to large projects. Tests for determining shear strength include the standard penetration test (SPT), static cone penetration , vane shear, pressuremeter, and the Iowa borehole s{\~{}}ear tests. The SPT has been the most widely used, but is least accurate. The static cone and pressuremeter provide more reliable data and are expected to be increasingly employed. The vane shear test, previously considered to be very reliable in soft clays, is now known to frequently overestimate soil strength. The borehole shear test, a rapid and low cost technique, is limited to soils with some cohesion suitable for stage testing. In-situ stresses may be determined by pressure cells, hydraulic fracturing and the pressuremeter; deformation characteristics by.the pressuremeter, plate load tests, seismic methods and back analysis of completed projects. The pressuremeter is seen as being of great promise. Hydraulic fracturing tests, while suitable for use in rock, provide results which are often extremely difficult to interpret in soils. Seismic methods of determining elastic moduli involve very small strains, so results need to be corrected before application in most cases. Plate load tests can yield accurate estimates of properties, but costs may be prohibitively high. Volume change parameters have not often been measured by in-situ methods. However, tne following techniques may be successfully employed: borehole permeability tests, penetration resistance (both dynamic and static), plate bearing tests, screw plate tests, and the pressuremeter. In-situ permeability tests are particularly well suited for the evaluation of the consolidation rate of fine grained soils. Correlations of penetration resistance with volume change characteristics are empirical and may yield misleading results. Both the load bearing and screw plate tests can provide reliable volume change parameters. However, because of practical time limitations, their use is mostly restricted to sands and slightly cohesive soils.},

Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) methods, operating over regular grids, are perhaps the best known among such methods, which simulate the acoustic field in its entirety over the problem domain. In a realistic room acoustics setting, working over a regular grid is attractive from a computational standpoint, but is complicated by geometrical considerations, particularly when the geometry does not conform neatly to the grid, and those of boundary conditions which emulate the properties of real wall materials. Both such features may be dealt with through an appeal to methods operating over unstructured grids, such as finite volume methods, which reduce to FDTD when employed over regular grids. Through numerical energy analysis, such methods lead to direct stability conditions for complex problems, including convenient geometrical conditions at irregular boundaries.

abstract = {Conventional soil improvement techniques can lead to permanent soil pollution or emission of carbon dioxide. It is therefore a challenge for engineers to design alternative sustainable and cost-effective grouting techniques. In Microbial Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP), bacterial activity leading to calcite precipitation is created and the precipitated calcite acts as a cementing agent in the soil. Bacterial strains producing urease can indeed have a major impact on the natural calcite precipitation process when supplied with nutrients and urea. The miscible and reactive biogrout injection in saturated, deformable soil need to be better described to more effectively design this innovative grouting technique. A comprehensive research work is therefore carried out on this topic. The field equations for biogrout transport are established based on the understanding of the complex processes involved: bio-hydro-mechanical couplings, transport, miscibility, bacterial growth and decay and bacterial attachment and detachment. The resulting set of field equations is discretized and implemented into an advanced finite element code. Finite element modelling of column injection tests is carried out to validate the formulation and demonstrate the potentiality of the developed model.

abstract = {In this paper, the effects of penetration rate on cone resistance in saturated clayey soils are investigated. Shear strength rate effects in clayey soils are related to two physical processes: the increase of shear strength with increasing rate of loading and the increase of shear strength as the process transitions from undrained to drained. Special focus is placed on this second effect. Cone penetration tests were performed at various penetration rates both in the field and in a calibration chamber, and the resulting data were analyzed. The field cone penetration tests were performed at two test sites with fairly homogeneous clayey silt and silty clay layers located below the groundwater table. Additionally, tests with both cone and flat-tip penetrometers in sand-clay mixtures were performed in a calibration chamber to investigate the change in drainage conditions from undrained to partially drained and from partially drained to fully drained. A series of flexible-wall permeameter tests were conducted in the laboratory for various clayey sand mixtures prepared at various mixing ratios in order to obtain values of the coefficient of consolidation, which is required to estimate the penetration rates below which penetration is drained and above which penetration is undrained. A correlation between cone resistance and drainage conditions was established based on the results of the calibration chamber and field penetration tests.},

These materials are characterized by a very flat particle size distribution. An evaluation of the mechanical characteristics of coarse-grained soils is complicated to perform due to the presence of large-sized elements. Given the complexity of natural coarse-grained soils, a special classification of coarse-grained soils composed of large elements surrounded by a fine sandy matrix (i.e. coarse-grained soils with a matrix) has been studied herein. The reference soils are composed of a mix of Fontainebleau sand and various types of inclusions (gravel and glass beads). Thanks to tests conducted with a triaxial device, the influence of key parameters on behavior observed in the domain of both small and large strains could be highlighted; volumetric fraction, particle size distribution and spread, morphological properties of the inclusions, and initial state of the matrix. Finally, we present the bases for a new methodology evaluating the mechanical characteristics of these soils by use of a homogenization type approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers. The response of infinite cylinder expanding in a poroelastic medium is investigated analytically in this paper on the basis of Biot's consolidation theory. The approach is based on the local equivalence between the response of a perfectly plastic behavior to the monotonic loading process and an appropriate fictitious nonlinear poroelastic behavior. A simplified framework was adopted for the diffusion equation to derive a closed-form expression for pore-fluid pressure distribution, whereas stresses and displacements were computed numerically. The related theoretical results are discretized and critically compared to finite-element solution, showing good agreement in terms of radial stresses and normalized pore pressure distributions. For in situ testing, interpretation, and foundation design purposes, results interpreted in the space of normalized velocity (V) versus degree of drainage (U) demonstrate the model capability of capturing the transitions from drainage to partially drained and undrained soil regimes.},

This process produce a considerable quantity of residue, called “relave” (to extract 1kg of copper, the process will produce 99kg of “relave”). His behaviour it's like a sandy material with a percent of fines without cohesion ({\%}{\textless}80µm), and with an important presence of water. For storing, the final destination of the “relaves” is in dams called “tranques de relaves” (mine residue deposit), and they are built with the same material. It's necessary take into account that Chili is the first producer of copper of the world (37{\%} of the production), and the price of the copper has history levels in the lasts years (402{\$}US/lb), so, the production of relave is very important, and the size of the dams too. On the other hand, Chili is one of the seismic countries of the world (average of 30 earthquakes/day), where the last big earthquake was the 27 of February of 2010 (8,9 Richet scale). This Chilean structure are submitted constantly to dynamic solicitation product of the earthquakes. It's necessary take account that the nature of “relave”, one of the problems more frequently and complexes that affect the dams it's the liquefaction. Today, for the determination of the liquefaction potential in-situ of a soil, exist different methods that are based on penetrometriques tests. The methods more used are les penetrometriques test CPT and SPT. However, should be taken into account the aspects geographic, geometrics, of access, of time, of cost{\ldots} by the “tranque de relaves”, the realisation of this type of test it's almost “utopic'. For that it's urgent to study news methods with less stringent, allowing to make a diagnostic of this structures in a faster way, like the proposed method by Villavicencio (2009), including the lasts progress made in the area of in-situ tests. The objective of this study is propose a new methodology, allowing of the determination of the liquefaction potential, with the tests of PANDA 3{\textregistered} (Benz et al, 2010) and the g{\'{e}}oendoscopy ‘Haddani, 2004), designed and developed by Sol-Solution. The idea is to obtain parameters of resistance and dynamics deformation of soil with the test PANDA 3{\textregistered}, and by other way, the grain nature, especially the D50 and the percent of fines ({\%}{\textless}80µm) of “relaves” by the analyse of images g{\'{e}}oendoscopics. This study rest principally on the bibliographic study of the different methods, allowing the determination of the liquefaction potential of soils in-situ, and this will be serve of base for the development of a new method.},

Modeling techniques are first validated against existing experimental results and then used to treat the blast-induced shock-wave propagation and tunnel response in dry and saturated sands. Results show that the tunnel buried in saturated sand responds earlier than that in dry sand. Tunnel deformations decrease with distance from the explosive in both sands, as expected. In the vicinity of the explosive, the tunnel buried in saturated sand suffered permanent deformation in both axial and circumferential directions, whereas the tunnel buried in dry sand recovered from most of the axial deformation. Overall, response of the tunnel in saturated sand is more severe for a given blast event and shows the detrimental effect of pore water on the blast response of buried tunnels. The validated modeling techniques developed in this paper can be used to investigate the blast response of tunnels buried in dry and saturated sands.},

We show that this crossover grows with the confining pressure {\$}P{\_}0{\$}, whereas the shock wave speed is independent of {\$}P{\_}0{\$} --- two hallmarks of granular shocks predicted recently. The shocks exhibit powerlaw attenuation, which we model with a logarithmic law implying that local dissipation is weak.

The sand is modeled as a nonlinear elastic-plastic material. The theory can be used for analysis of calibration chamber tests, as it takes full account of chamber size and boundary conditions. The theory was used to calculate values of cone penetration resistance for the conditions corresponding to each of about 400 cone penetration tests performed in different calibration chambers. The chamber diameters range from 0.76 to 1.20 m and the cone penetrometer diameters from 1 to 3.57 cm. The samples were prepared of different sands at different densities and stresses. The agreement between theoretical and experimental values was better than ±30{\%} in most cases.},

abstract = {Previously, in situ tests have been conducted in cold regions since infrastructures such as pipelines have been actively built on frozen ground. However, the engineering properties such as shear strength have not been directly evaluated from in situ tests. The objective of this study is to correlate the shear strength of frozen soils determined by the direct shear tests with the dynamic cone penetration index (DCPI) measured by the instrumented dynamic cone penetrometer (IDCP). The IDCP, which incorporates strain gauges and an accelerometer to measure the energy transferred to the cone tip, is used to estimate the energy-corrected dynamic cone penetration index (energy-corrected DCPI). The direct shear apparatus and the calibration chamber for the IDCP application test are placed in the freezer. The sand–silt mixtures are prepared in the shear box and the calibration chamber at the degree of saturation of 10{\%} and relative density of 60{\%}. Vertical confining stresses are applied to the specimens during the freezing and strength evaluating phases, such as direct shearing or penetrating the IDCP, to determine the effect of the vertical confining condition. The experimental results show that the shear strength of the frozen soils increases in a nonlinear parabolic shape with an increase in the vertical confining stress. Furthermore, the vertical confining stress during the strength evaluating phase has more influence on the strength than that during the freezing phase because the degree of saturation of specimens is low. As the energy transferred to the cone tip is affected by the soil conditions under the cone tip, the energy-corrected DCPI, which is inversely proportional to the shear strength, has a better relationship with the shear strength. This study demonstrates that the energy-corrected DCPI can be effectively used for the evaluation of the shear strength of frozen soils.},

abstract = {Dyke's failure is a real problem that managers have to face. Failure cases are frequently observed, especially in developing countries. However, apart from simple visual inspections, the means of recognition of the hydraulic works are often heavy and expensive to apply. We propose by this work, an organization of methods and both original and economic techniques to help the manager to improve his knowledge about the park. The report is thus composed of three parts covering the general problems and two strong points of the diagnosis method suggested: ? the diagnosis method : an AMDE approach is presented, allowing the analysis of critical damages scenarios applied to a typical embankment model. The nature of degradations, their criticality and the observation scale condition the selected techniques as well as the organisation of the method (observation and temperature measures of the seeping water at the global scale, mechanical resistance at the scale of section and permeability at the scale of the soil layers), ? the estimation de mechanical stability : the purpose is to apply penetrometric techniques that are lights and economic in the aim to estimate the mechanical behaviour of a section. The use on embankments of these techniques is approached under a practical aspect (access, depth of investigation, surface layer{\ldots}) as well as theoretical (grid optimisation, estimation of the short term mechanical resistance in fine-grained saturated layers, spatialisation of the information). These techniques are completed by in situ permeability measurements ; for this a low scale perm{\'{e}}am{\`{e}}tre adapted to 4 cm² drillings is studied and developed. Laboratory and in situ measures, compared to a laboratory approach show the pertinence of this new equipment that allows the characterisation of soil layers and that delivers also an information about the average permeability of a section, ? the in situ estimation of the liquefaction potential and post-seismic resistance : we build a method derived from Robertson's, using point resistance and soil characterisation obtained from in situ permeability measures for estimating the liquefaction potential of soil. In addition, we are interested in post-seismic resistance of liquefiable materials ; for that, we carry out a serial of cyclic triaxial tests in the aim to obtain liquefied silt samples. These samples are then tested in compression. The correlation between post-cyclic resistance measures and point resistance before cycling leads to establish two criteria for evaluating post-seismic resistance in the case of this material. Each criterion is applied to a real case ; whatever the criterion, the embankment is likely to collapse under seismic conditions},

The inherent variability and measurement error are addressed in a common paper, and transformation uncertainty is addressed herein. A second-moment probabilistic approach is applied to combine these uncertainties consistently based on the manner in which the design soil property is derived. The design properties considered in this paper are undrained shear strength, effective stress friction angle, in situ horizontal stress coefficient, and Young's modulus. This paper concludes with specific guidelines on the typical coefficients of variation for these common design soil properties as a function of the test type and the type of correlation used.},

abstract = {Calcareous sand has distinct characteristics in comparison with silica sand, such as dynamic behavior at high strain rates (HSRs). This is closely related to pile driving, aircraft wheel loading and mining activities. To understand the response of calcareous sand at HSRs, a series of dynamic tests is performed using the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) with steel sleeve, including 6 validation tests of bar-against-bar and 16 comparative tests relevant to the relative density and strain rate of calcareous and silica sands. The apparent dynamic stiffness of calcareous sand is approximately 10{\%} of that for silica sand due to different particle shapes and mineral compositions. The axial stress-strain response of silica sand is mainly governed by the deformation of individual grain and soil skeleton, and particle crushing. However, porous calcareous sand shows yielding and strain-hardening responses that are always followed by particle crushing. As the applied loading increases, the particle crushing of calcareous sand develops from local instability to whole breakage. Calcareous sand has lower viscous flow effects compared with silica sand at HSRs.},

abstract = {This study is an attempt to evaluate relative density and friction angle of sands on the basis of SPT-N values. In order to develop the relationships among relative density (Dr), friction angle (ϕ) and SPT-N value, field and laboratory test results from sixty boreholes executed in sandy deposit were used. The field tests include the SPTs conducted in the boreholes and the determination of in-situ density at various depths in the boreholes using the pitcher sampler whereas the laboratory tests include routine classification, direct shear box, maximum and minimum density and specific gravity tests. The SPT-N values were observed to vary between 4 and 100 and the in-situ bulk density of undisturbed samples as recovered through pitcher sampler are in the range of 13.24 {\~{}} 18.44 kN/m3. The soil samples are classified as poorly graded sand (SP), poorly graded sand with silt (SP-SM) and silty sand (SM) on the basis of Unified Soil Classification System. The values of minimum dry unit weight fall in the range of 12.22{\~{}}14.95 kN/m3 and maximum dry unit weight varies in the range of 14.64{\~{}}19.17 kN/m3 as obtained through vibratory table. Based on the test results, correlation analysis was performed to identify the parameters that affect relative density. The parameters include SPT-N value corrected for field procedures (N60), relative density (Dr), void ratio range (emax–emin), effective overburden stresses ($\sigma$v') and in-situ dry density ($\gamma$df). Based on the results of correlation analyses, it was observed that SPT-N values alone cannot be related to Dr. Therefore, multiple regression analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software and relation between relative density, corrected SPT-N value and effective overburden stress is being proposed. The variation between experimental and predicted values falls within ± 10{\%} at 95{\%} confidence interval. Validation of the proposed correlation was also performed by using an independent data set which indicated that the prediction by using the proposed correlation also falls within ± 10{\%}. Further, comparison of the proposed correlation with other similar relationships already available in the literature was also performed. In addition to the above, correlation between ϕ and SPT-N60 has also been proposed. It has been observed that the experimental and predicted values of friction angle fall within ± 10{\%} with 95{\%} confidence interval. The proposed correlations may be very useful in the field of geotechnical engineering during feasibility/preliminary design stage for rapid estimation of relative density or friction angle based on the field SPT-N60 values.},

@article{Ceccato2014,
abstract = {The numerical simulation of real geomechanical problems often entails an high level of complexity; indeed they are often characterized by large deformations, soil-structure interaction and solid-fluid interaction. Moreover, the constitutive behavior of soil is highly non-linear. Landslides, dam failure, pile installation, and undrground excavation are typical examples of large deformation problems in which the interaction between solid a fluid phase as well as the contact between bodies are essential. This thesis addresses the challenging issue of the numerical simulation of large deformation problems in geomechanics. The standard lagrangian finite element methods are not well suited to treat extremely large deformations because of severe difficulties related with mesh distortions. The need to overcome their drawbacks urged researchers to devote considerable effort to the development of more advanced computational techniques such as meshless methods and mesh based particle methods. In this study, the Material Point Method (MPM), which is a mesh based particle method, is exploited to simulate large deformation problems in geomechanics. The MPM simulates large displacements with Lagrangian material points (MP) moving through a fixed mesh. The MP discretize the continuum body and carry all the information such as mass, velocity, acceleration, material properties, stress and strains, as well as external loads. The mesh discretizes the domain where the body move through; it is used to solve the equations of motion, but it does not store any permanent information. In undrained and drained conditions the presence of water can be simulated in a simplified way using the one-phase formulation. However, in many cases the relative movement of the water respect to the soil skeleton must be taken into account, thus requiring the use of the two-phase formulation. The contact between bodies is simulated with an algorithm specifically developed for the MPM at the beginning of the century. This algorithm was originally formulated for the frictional contact. It extension to the adhesive contact is considered in this thesis, which is well suited to simulate soil-structure interaction in case of cohesive materials. In this thesis typical geomechanical problems such as the collapse of a submerged slope and the simulation of cone penetration testing are considered. Numerical results are successfully compared with experimental data thus confirming the capability of the MPM to simulate complex phenomena.},

The ICP consists of a cone tip and rods equipped with an accelerometer and four strain gauges, which allow dynamic driving, in addition to quasi-static pushing of the cone. The force and velocity of the cone are measured using the ICP instrumentation and compared with the N value, dynamic cone penetration index, and static cone resistance. A strong correlation has been observed between the total cone resistance estimated from the ICP and the dynamic cone penetration index and static cone resistance. After the correction of the dynamic cone resistance effect, the static component of the total cone resistance can be used as an alternative to a static cone resistance. This novel approach of soil resistance estimation using the ICP may be useful for dense layer characterization.},

abstract = {The paper presents recommendations for conducting site characterisation programs to determine the geotechnical properties of cohesive offshore sediments with the primary focus being on clays. The engineering behaviour of clays is complex and characterisation of their in situ properties is magnified by additional challenges presented by offshore environments. Site investigation programs are best conducted using well calibrated in situ tests and laboratory testing of high quality undisturbed samples. Results from these test programs should be coupled with geophysical data and collectively evaluated in the context of a regional geological framework. The paper reviews clay behaviour, describes the unique conditions of offshore environments, and lists key cohesive soil parameters required for infrastructure design and geohazards analysis. Best practice recommendations founded on these fundamentals are then presented including drilling methods, in situ testing and instrumentation, soil sampling, laboratory testing and evaluation of test data. The paper concludes with an assessment of present and future challenges. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, London.},

abstract = {This paper compares the void ratio obtained in samples prepared by dry and moist tamping, and dry and wet pluviation. These 4 methods are amongst the few other commonly adopted methods used in the preparation of reconstituted sand samples in the laboratory e.g. slurry deposition and vibration. The samples were prepared in 100mm diameter and 200mm long split moulds. The effects of the number of soil layers and the drop height of the tamper, on particle packing, were studied in the tamping method. Microscopic images of these samples showed that the packing was more compact between the interface of two adjacent layers in tamped samples. In the pluviation method, the distance through which the sand particles were rained and the mass-flow were the two investigated parameters. The mass-flow was varied with the use of 3 different funnel openings. Frictional drag because of the air was ignored in the pluviation tests. The dry pluviation results seem to suggest that up to the limiting mass-flow, the funnel opening has a greater influence on the void ratio than the height through which the sand is rained. Furthermore, the tendency of the medium to dense air pluviated samples to dilate in drained triaxial test was not evident in the wet pluviated samples. The dilation was otherwise observed to be the maximum in dry tamped samples.},

Hugoniot and sound velocities of LiF are obtained via the Lagrangian analysis. The drop in the longitudinal sound velocity to bulk sound velocity between 134 and 152 GPa, suggests that shock-induced melting initiates at 134-152 GPa. The Gruneisen parameter as a function of shock-state density is determined. Given high-pressure Gruneisen parameters, shock temperature and melting curve of B1 phase LiF are calculated, and consistent with previous molecular dynamics and ab initio calculations, as well as diamond-anvil cell and shock wave measurements. Our calculation suggests that shock-induced melting initiates at 142 GPa, in agreement with our sound velocity measurements.},

abstract = {Geotechnical applications often involve large displacements of structural elements, such as penetrometers or footings, in soil. Three numerical analysis approaches capable of accounting for large deformations are investigated here: the implicit remeshing and interpolation technique by small strain (RITSS), an efficient Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (EALE) implicit method and the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) approach available as part of commercial software. The theoretical basis and implementation of the methods are discussed before their relative performance is evaluated through four benchmark cases covering static, dynamic and coupled problems in geotechnical engineering. Available established analytical and numerical results are also provided for comparison purpose. The advantages and limitation of the different approaches are highlighted. The RITSS and EALE predict comparable results in all cases, demonstrating the robustness of both in-house codes. Employing implicit integration scheme, RITSS and EALE have stable convergence although their computational efficiency may be low for high-speed problems. The CEL is commercially available, but user expertise on element size, critical step time and critical velocity for quasi-static analysis is required. Additionally, mesh-independency is not satisfactorily achieved in the CEL analysis for the dynamic case.},

Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the remapping and advection algorithms and cone-penetration simulations. Cone penetration at a Boston blue clay site is simulated with the Mohr-Coulomb, modified Cam clay, and MIT-S1 constitutive models and compared with measured cone-penetration test profiles. Single-element simulations illustrate that the MIT-S1 constitutive model captures the significant undrained shear-strength anisotropy exhibited by Boston blue clay, whereas the modified Cam clay and Mohr-Coulomb models do not. Penetration simulations demonstrate the important effect of undrained shear-strength anisotropy on the cone tip resistance, as well as on stress and pore pressure fields around the cone tip and rod.},

abstract = {Laboratory investigations such as resonant column, cyclic triaxial, and torsional shear tests are usually conducted on undisturbed and reconstituted sand samples in order to determine their shear modulus, which can be used to compute shear wave velocity. However, these methods are extremely cumbersome and indirect, they employ cost-intensive instrumentation, and they require trained manpower. These problems can be overcome by using bender elements, which yield the shear wave velocity of sands directly, easily, and quite rapidly. In this context, efforts made by earlier researchers in developing empirical relationships (based on bender elements and resonant column techniques) which can be employed to compute shear wave velocity in sands are worth consideration. Although these relationships take into account parameters like effective stress and void ratio, they do not directly incorporate fundamental characteristics of sands such as their state (i.e. dry or saturated) and the particle size. Thus a generalized relationship, which can be used to compute shear wave velocity in sands in either the dry or saturated state, has been developed. Experiments were conducted on samples of sand and glass beads of different sizes and the results were used to demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the relationship. Details of the methodology developed for this purpose are also presented in this paper.},

The paper first reviews the site's geotechnical conditions and their potential variations over time. The stringent laboratory requirements that are necessary for the accurate measurement of shear stiffness, strength, and creep strains are then discussed, before presenting illustrative results regarding the sand's small strain stiffness and time-dependent behaviour. The importance of reproducing site conditions and stress states are also addressed in relation to integrating the laboratory research with field observations and analyses of both recent and historical piling experiments at the Dunkirk test site.},

abstract = {A complete characterization detailing the intricate and complex response of geomaterials remains a challenging task that can only be realized on a partial basis via a careful drilling and sampling program coupled with detailed laboratory testing and comprehensive series of in-situ tests and field geophysics. As now evidenced from results reported from over 60 international geotechnical experimentation sites at worldwide locations, such extensive efforts directed at a particular soil formation take decades of time and considerable funding for completion. For a practical approach in routine site characterizations, the minimal standard of work should be seismic piezocone tests (SCPTu) or seismic flat dilatometer tests (SDMT), as up to 5 separate measurements of soil behavior are captured during a single sounding. These results should be supplemented with sampling and laboratory testing directed at defining parameters within a rational effective stress framework, and in particular, critical state soil mechanics (CSSM). Even then, a number of challenges remain, including the appreciation of rate effects, fabric, particle breakage, weathering, and diagenesis. Furthermore, nontextbook geomaterials (e.g., silty sands, carbonate clays, diatomaceous earth, peats, organic silts) will require a considerably higher level of testing and investigative effort because of greater uncertainty in understanding their anomalous behavior. Also, the characterization of geosynthetics, often used to complement or replace the function of earthen materials in many structures (e.g., reinforcement, drainage) requires the characterization of product-specific hydraulic, mechanical, and rheological properties},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. The influence of gradation and particle shape on the small-strain Young's modulus of dry sands is investigated through a comprehensive set of resonant column tests in the flexural mode of vibration. Experiments are performed on an array of sands with different coefficients of uniformity and particle shapes. The effect of gradation is investigated using tests on sands with similar particle shapes. The effect of particle shape is then examined through the experimental results on sands with a range of particle shapes. A new model is developed to incorporate the effects of gradation and particle shape into the prediction of the small-strain Young's modulus. The proposed model is verified and compared with the existing models in the literature using the state parameter in the critical state soil mechanics framework. It is shown that the proposed model outperforms the previous ones considering the significant effect of particle shape on the small-strain Young's modulus. Using the theory of elasticity, a model is developed for the prediction of Poisson's ratio for sands taking into account the effects of particle shape and gradation.},

By utilising an incrementally non-linear model and various types of loading paths (i.e. proportional loading and with multiple bends) stability and uniqueness are more precisely investigated in the case of undrained paths on loose sands. The theoretical results are also analysed with respect to the convergency of the response curves when the length of bends decreases. It is then shown that some conclusions obtained in the case of undrained loading can be generalised for a large class of stress paths. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

The constitutive model is based on a rock-aging law for the uniaxial strength of the rock and for the Young's modulus. A semianalytical solution is developed for the stresses and displacements around a deep circular tunnel taking into account the face advance. The evolution of the plastic and damage zones over time is determined. Numerical examples are presented for the case of Saint-Martin-La-Porte access adit in France of the Lyon-Turin Base Tunnel. The computed results which are compared with the field data in terms of the convergence of tunnel wall and of the displacements inside the rock mass monitored by multi-point extensometers show the efficiency of the approach to simulate the time-dependent deformation of a tunnel excavated in squeezing ground. Simple relationships are proposed to evaluate the parameters of the constitutive model directly from those of the empirical convergence law presented in previous work.},

abstract = {The electric cone penetration test (CPT) has been in use for over 40 years and is growing in popularity in North America. This paper provides some recent updates on the interpretation of some key geotechnical parameters in an effort to develop a more unified approach. Extensive use is made of the normalized soil behaviour type (SBTn) chart based on normalized cone resistance (Qt) and normalized friction ratio (Fr). Updates are provided regarding the normalization process and its application to the identification of soil type. The seismic CPT has provided extensive data linking CPT net cone resistance to shear-wave velocity and soil modulus. New correlations are presented in the form of contours of key parameters on the SBTn chart. These new relationships enable a more unified interpretation of CPT results over a wide range of soils. Updates are also provided in terms of in situ state parameter, peak friction angle, and soil sensitivity. The correlations are evaluated using available laboratory and full-scale field test results. Many of the recommendations contained in this paper are focused on low to moderate risk projects where empirical interpretation tends to dominate. For projects where more advanced methods are more appropriate, the recommendations provided in this paper can be used as a screening to evaluate critical regions-zones where selective additional in situ testing and sampling maybe appropriate. {\textcopyright} 2009 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {The inherent and stress-induced anisotropy of saturated Hostun sand has been examined by means of shear wave velocity measurements under drained monotonic and cyclic triaxial conditions. Tests were carried out on samples prepared by moist tamping for a wide range of initial densities in a fully instrumented stress-path triaxial apparatus equipped with bender element instrumentation in three directions. Data have been normalised to account for the variations in void ratio and mean effective stress. The evolution of shear stiffness under anisotropic stress conditions has been explored by performing both constant mean effective stress tests and constant radial stress tests in compression and extension. Some samples were subsequently subjected to multiple drained deviatoric loading cycles, and the evolution of shear stiffness was examined. The tests showed that the initial inherent anisotropy was small, namely, lower than that previously observed in dry pluviated samples of the same sand in a cubical cell apparatus. Changing stress levels in compression or extension resulted in stress-induced anisotropy even when there were no changes in the values for p′, indicating that the widely-used empirical expressions for G0 under isotropic stress states are not strictly applicable under anisotropic stress conditions. The comparison between stress-induced anisotropy in compression and in extension is discussed, and the evolution of shear stiffness during drained cyclic loading is examined. It is concluded that the changes in inherent anisotropy during these tests were small, but that new constitutive models should account for such changes in state with appropriate normalization.},

Experimental and analytical methods are implemented in this study to explore various aspects of bender element installations including: electromagnetic coupling prevention, directivity, resonant frequency, detection of first arrival, and near field effects. It is shown that electromagnetic coupling effects are critical in soils with high electrical conductivity and can be minimized by shielding and grounding, or by using parallel-type bender elements. Bender elements generate both P- and S-waves. The in-plane S-wave directivity is quasicircular. The resonant frequency of bender element installations depends on the geometry of the bender element, the anchor efficiency, and the soil stiffness. The cross correlation of subsequent reflections is a self-healing measurement procedure which resolves uncertainties in both travel time and travel distance. Near field effects can be effectively taken into consideration by matching the measured signal with the analytical solution, directly rendering shear wave velocity.},

This paper proposes a comprehensive set of criteria and recommendations for quality control (QC) of compacted subgrade that take into account the inherent statistical variability of DCP test results. For the development of the QC criteria, a new statistical methodology is used to extract representative test values from the raw field DCP test data. In order to use the proposed QC criteria, soils are first classified into two broad categories (fine-grained and coarse-grained) depending on their fabric and response to compaction efforts. Test results indicate that (i) for fine-grained soils, the DCP test values have good correlation with the plasticity index (PI), which is indicative of the type and amount of clay content of the soil and (ii) for coarse-grained soils, the DCP test values have good correlation with the optimum water content of the soil, which is directly related to its in situ density. DCP blow count correlation equations are presented for both soil categories. Recommendations for field DCP testing and data analysis are also provided to highlight the significance of the statistical distribution of the DCP test results in QC testing of compacted subgrade.},

abstract = {Establishing the stress conditions developed around displacement piles in sands is crucial to improving the understanding and modeling of their behavior. High-quality experiments and theoretical analyses are providing new insights into the effects of penetration on stress conditions. This paper synthesizes the findings from three independent experimental studies on normally consolidated silica sands and a trio of numerical analyses that tackle the problem from different perspectives. The significant degrees of uncertainty in the measurements and predictions are recognized and significant differences between data sets are discussed and largely resolved. Applying a consistent normalized interpretive framework leads to clear common trends regarding how installation affects the stress regime. While the main emphasis is placed on the radial effective stresses developed around pile shafts, the circumferential and vertical stress states are also considered. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

However, soil testing is limited and the description and quantification of the resulting soil variability still remain largely subjective in practice. In this paper, anapproach is proposed to rationally evaluate the soil spatial variability using field data provided by a site investigation programme based on a lightweight dynamic cone penetrometer test. The first part deals with the boundary identification of statistically mechanical homogeneous soil units. The second part focuses on modelling spatial variability through 3D conditional random fields in the homogeneous soil units previously identified. This approach has been applied to and studied in a real site investigation carried out in an alluvial Mediterranean deltaic environment.},

abstract = {It has been observed in piezocone dissipation tests that the measured pore water pressure may initially increase and then decrease with time. This phenomenon has been designated as "non-standard" dissipation. For cone penetrometers with the filter element used for measuring pore water pressure located at the shoulder of the cone, the results of numerically simulated cone penetration and pore pressure dissipation indicate that the "non-standard" dissipation curves are mainly caused by (a) shear-induced dilatancy of overconsolidated clays or dense sandy soils around the cone and (b) possible unloading effects for soil elements moving from the vicinity of the face to the shoulder of the cone. Using the results of an uncoupled radial consolidation analysis, an empirical method has been established for interpreting the field value of the horizontal coefficient of consolidation (c h) from "non-standard" dissipation curves. The proposed method has been applied to the numerically simulated "non-standard" dissipation predictions as well as the results of some field cases available in the literature. It is concluded that the values of c h evaluated from the proposed method are more representative of the field values than those evaluated using available alternative methods. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Accurate design of geotechnical structures requires precise estimation of the shear wave velocity (Vs) and the small-strain shear modulus. However, the interpretation of Vs data measured in deformed/sheared soil has not been extensively considered. This study used a triaxial apparatus equipped with planar piezoelectric transducers to monitor the evolution of Vs during triaxial compression of cohesionless soils. Recognizing that the grain shape and surface characteristics affect the overall mechanical response of granular materials, various natural sands and glass bead samples were considered. Discrete element method (DEM) simulations using spherical particles were carried out to compute particle-scale responses that cannot be measured in the laboratory. The experimental results revealed that the Vs values for samples with different initial densities tend to approach one another and have similar values (merge) at large axial strains. This merging occurs at a lower strain level for spherical particles in comparison with non-spherical particles. The linear Vs-void ratio relationship, which is often developed and used for homogeneous and isotropic stress states, is no longer applicable during shearing. It is the mean coordination number that dictates the evolution of Vs during triaxial compression. Furthermore, the axial strain at which the peak Vs is achieved is found to be comparable to the axial strain at which specimen dilation takes place.},

abstract = {Cone penetration in soil is a complex process. The complexity arises partly from the boundary-value problem itself, in which a penetrometer with a conical tip is pushed down at constant rate through a (possibly heterogeneous) soil mass of infinite extent in the horizontal direction but with a free horizontal surface, and from the nature of the soil, a particulate material with strongly nonlinear mechanical response. Because of the advantages of using cone penetration as a means of characterizing a soil site, the problem of linking the cone penetration resistance to fundamental properties of the soil has received considerable attention in research. Experimental work has included field testing and laboratory testing in test chambers and geotechnical centrifuges, and theoretical work has included early efforts with rigid-plastic, limit equilibrium-type analysis (ultimately not satisfactory), cavity expansion-based analyses (fairly successful in the analysis of cone penetration through homogenous soil), strain path methods (fairly successful in the modeling of cone penetration through homogeneous clay) and recent efforts of analyzing the problem more rigorously using large-deformation numerical analyses. Experimental work using half chambers and centrifuges with half cones penetrating a soil sample next to a Plexiglass wall with simultaneous collection of images during penetration has allowed use of Digital Image Correlation (DIC) methods to understand the displacement field around a penetrating cone. Collectively, these techniques have generated a body of knowledge that allows effective interpretation of cone penetration tests, but rigorous theoretical simulation of cone penetration has not yet been achieved.},

Both optimum and wet of optimum compacted specimens have been tested to analyze the effects of suction and fabric on soil behavior.

Collected data indicate an S-shaped initial shear stiffness versus suction variation, which can be explained considering the progressive change from a bulk-water regulated soil response to a menisci-water regulated soil response.

Numerical models are often employed to capture these interactions. However, there is little information in the literature with respect to soil-projectile kinematic interactions. In this paper, the results of low velocity projectile penetration in granular media are presented. Refractive index matched transparent soil with mechanical properties similar to angular natural sand is used as the target granular media. High-speed imaging is adapted to capture images of an embedded axisymmetric plane within the sample during projectile penetration. Digital image correlation is used to derive the temporal evolution of the displacement field during penetration. Kinematic analysis is performed to investigate the characteristics of the soil-projectile interactions. The results indicate that the soil immediately below the projectile moves predominantly downward as the projectile approaches the soil. Radially away from the projectile, there is a transition from downward movement to horizontal movement. Once the projectile passes a given depth, the soil continues to move downward, as momentum is transferred to the soil.},

The analyses were done with an advanced bounding-surface-plasticity constitutive model. The mechanical response of soil elements at various locations between the group piles was thoroughly investigated to reveal the underlying pile-soil-pile interaction mechanisms. Pile group efficiency was found to be a function of the pile head settlement, number of piles in the group, pile-to-pile spacing, and relative density of the sand. The effect of cap-soil contact on the pile group resistance development was also studied. For small pile groups, the group efficiency is close to or greater than 1 at settlement levels likely to be of interest in design.},

En effet, nonlin{\'{e}}arit{\'{e}}, non-r{\'{e}}versibilit{\'{e}}, dilatance, effet du temps, anisotropie sont autant de caract{\'{e}}ristiques du comportement du squelette des sols, auquel il faut adjoindre le couplage avec la pression interstitielle pour les sols fins satur{\'{e}}s. Sujet n{\'{e}}cessaire car, devant cette complexit{\'{e}}, il convient d'avoir une approche pragmatique et r{\'{e}}a-liste pour dimensionner les ouvrages g{\'{e}}otechniques. Apr{\`{e}}s le d{\'{e}}veloppement de mod{\`{e}}les de comportement g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ral du sol comportant un grand nombre de param{\`{e}}tres et qui s'est heurt{\'{e}} au probl{\`{e}}me de leur d{\'{e}}termination et de leut mesure, ce sont maintenant des mod{\`{e}}les plus simples, souvent de type {\'{e}}lastoplastique, voire m{\^{e}}me {\'{e}}lastique, qui sont utilis{\'{e}}s, mais dans lesquels le module de d{\'{e}}formation pris en compte est adapt{\'{e}} au type de sollicitation propre {\`{a}} l'ouwage consid{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}. Ainsi, pour un sol donn{\'{e}}, il n'y a pas un seul module, mais un grand nombre de moduies. Reste {\`{a}} choisir celui qui est le plus appropri{\'{e}} et pour ce faire, les retours d'exp{\'{e}}rience et les r{\'{e}}sultats d'instrumentations sont d'une importance capitale. Olivier Combarieu a pass{\'{e}} toute sa carri{\`{e}}re de g{\'{e}}otechnicien au laboratoire r{\'{e}}gional des Ponts et Chauss{\'{e}}es de Rouen du CETE de Normandie Centre. Il nous liwe ici son exp{\'{e}}rience, riche d'une grande diversit{\'{e}} d'ouwages dimensionn{\'{e}}s et de nombreuses recherches effectu{\'{e}}es, {\`{a}} propos notamment du pressiom{\`{e}}tre dont il faut rappeler qu'il est le seul essai rn situ courant qui donne un module de d{\'{e}}for-mation du sol. Apr{\`{e}}s avoir indiqu{\'{e}} les diff{\'{e}}rents modules que l'on peut tirer de l'essai pressiom{\'{e}}trique, il pr{\'{e}}sente une analyse critique et argument{\'{e}}e de leur utilisation possible dans deux domaines o{\`{u}} le choix du module de d{\'{e}}formation est capital: les tassements des fondations superficielles, puis les d{\'{e}}pla-cements lat{\'{e}}raux des parois souples et des pieux. Ses connaissances pratiques approfondies lui per-mettent d'apporter sur certains points un {\'{e}}clairage neuf, de bien montrer la compl{\'{e}}mentarit{\'{e}} existant entre essai aedom{\'{e}}trique et essai pressiom{\'{e}}trique; elles l'am{\`{e}}nent m{\^{e}}me {\`{a}} r{\'{e}}futer certaines pratiques erron{\'{e}}es pour recommander des m{\'{e}}thodes plus adapt{\'{e}}es, particuli{\`{e}}rement pour les charges de tr{\`{e}}s grandes dimensions sur sols compressibles. L'article ne comporte ni de longs calculs, ni de grandes th{\'{e}}ories. Nul doute qu'il sera appr{\'{e}}ci{\'{e}} de tous ceux qui, de pr{\`{e}}s ou de loin, s'int{\'{e}}ressent au calcul en d{\'{e}}formation des ouwages g{\'{e}}otechniques. l.Sl IE l= I rrl l.Ol l{\'{E}} Fran{\c{c}}ois SCHLOSSER L'auteur examine en d{\'{e}}tail la notion de module et l'usage qui en est fait dans le g{\'{e}}nie civil et tout particuli{\`{e}}rement en g{\'{e}}otechnique. Apr{\`{e}}s un rappel {\'{e}}l{\'{e}}mentaire du comportement {\'{e}}lastique et des essais initiaux en ayant permis l'{\'{e}}tude, la r{\'{e}}alit{\'{e}} du comportement est d{\'{e}}crite dans les deux domaines: celui du cisaillement (ou d{\'{e}}viatorique), et celui de la compression (ou sph{\'{e}}rique) dans les conditions de drainage ou non-drainage du sol. Les diff{\'{e}}rents essais d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}}s pour caract{\'{e}}riser les massifs sont d{\'{e}}crits, de m{\^{e}}me que les liens existant entre les divers param{\`{e}}tres de d{\'{e}}formation en r{\'{e}}sultant. Trois tylres de probl{\`{e}}mes tr{\`{e}}s courants sont ensuite expos{\'{e}}s, arrxquels l'auteur a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} confront{\'{e}}. 1) Tout d'abord, celui des tassements verticaux sous fondations superficielles et sous charge de tr{\`{e}}s grande dimension. Est r{\'{e}}affirm{\'{e}}e la pertinence, pour les sols peu compressibles, de l'approche pressiom{\'{e}}trique pour les fondations superficielles de dimensions transversales mod{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}es, de m{\^{e}}me que celle d'une approche {\'{e}}lastique {\`{a}} partir du module cyclique issu de l'essai pressiom{\'{e}}trique. Il est propos{\'{e}} un facteur correctif, non valid{\'{e}}, dans I'approche {\'{e}}lastique lorsque les dimensions, {\`{a}} la fois transversale et longitudinale, deviennent importantes. 2) Puis, celui des tassements des sols compressibles sous charges de tr{\`{e}}s grande {\'{e}}tendue o{\`{u}} l'approche pressiom{\'{e}}trique s'av{\`{e}}re inadapt{\'{e}}e et optimiste, ainsi que source possible d'erreurs graves, m{\^{e}}me si l'on propose d'en am{\'{e}}liorer la formulation. La m{\'{e}}thode aedom{\'{e}}trique reste la seule mani{\`{e}}re correcte d'appr{\'{e}}hender le probl{\`{e}}me. En revanche, pour les autres sols o{\`{u}} la consolidation est tr{\`{e}}s faible, il est propos{\'{e}} de modifier, en les diminuant fortement, les coefficients a de la th{\'{e}}orie pressiom{\'{e}}trique afln de rendre plus r{\'{e}}alistes les valeurs pessimistes de tassement auxquels les errements pressiom{\'{e}}triques actuels m{\`{e}}nent.},

abstract = {The shear modulus and the damping ratio at small strain are routinely obtained in the laboratory or field. The standard procedure in the laboratory is the resonant-column test (ASTM D-4015). However, the method has practical limitations because of its non-automatic execution. In the last 30 years the use of bender elements has been promoted for determining the shear wave velocity. This type of test, however, is controversial, as the results still have problems of repeatability. Therefore, there is no standard to conduct these tests. Alternative methods emerge as an attractive option to take advantage of a soil specimen. The objective of the present work was to develop and implement testing and interpretation methods based on small-strain measurements using either pulse or continuous sinusoidal signals and random noise. These techniques were implemented in a modified resonant-column apparatus equipped with a set of bender elements. The implementation included the development of an automatic control system, data acquisition system and data processing software. As a result, the improved laboratory equipment was able not only to perform resonant-column and bender element tests, but also to combine these methods to exploit the advantages of each device and to obtain additional information such as frequency effects and very small-strain stiffness. The work included the use of miniature accelerometers to study of the actual behaviour of the bender elements and the performance of the time and frequency domain testing methods. Finally, the results of a testing programme on a set of soils shown the validity of the techniques developed and verify some correlations and models.},

This situation has arisen primarily because, until recently, the mathematics of pile-driving action could not be solved in any practical manner. As a result all pile-driving formulas are partly empirical and, consequently, apply only to certain types or lengths of pile. This paper is presented with the purpose of giving engineers a mathematical method of wider application, depending on the use of electronic computers and numerical integration. The method is also applicable to other impact problems.},

The link between friction and dilation is well established, but quantitative expressions for the dependance of dilation on density and pressure are less well known. A new relationship based on the concepts of Critical State Soil Mechanics is suggested. The types of problem in which dilation plays an important role are then examined, and it is seen that dilatancy increases in significance for heavily constrained problems. The influence of dilation on the capacity of piles is treated in more detail. Additional topics treated include the generalization of dilation expressions.},

abstract = {Bentonite-sand mixture has been chosen as backfilling material to seal the galleries of high lev- el toxic waste disposal repositories. In India, bentonite from Rajasthan has been chosen as the possible barrier material for high level toxic waste disposal program. This paper illustrates the role of sand ratio on swelling pressure and hydraulic conductivity of the bentonite-sand mixture. Swelling pressure tests were conducted for different sand ratios such as 75, 70, 60 and 50{\%}. Similarly, compaction tests were conducted to determine the optimum moisture content and maximum dry density of bentonite-sand mixtures, for the sand ratio of 90, 80, 75, 70, 60 and 50{\%}. The hydraulic conductivity of the bentonite-sand mixtures was found out by using falling head method. The hydraulic conductivity values range from 7×10-6 to 1.6×10-10 m/s for the sand ratios of 90 and 50{\%}, respectively. In order to compare the falling head test results, hydraulic conductivity of the speci- mens was calculated indirectly from a series of consolidation tests. The hydraulic conductivity values deter- mined from both series of tests were found to be similar. The study was suggested that the most effective sand ratio of Indian barmer bentonite-sand mixtures, should not be more than 60{\%}},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This paper presents a calculation method for obtaining the continuous variation in stress between the tip and the soil during dynamic penetration tests, particularly in the case of using the Panda 3{\textregistered} penetration testing device. The originality of the method is that the tip stress can be computed continuously throughout the driving process. For each impact of the hammer on the penetrometer, data are recorded by sensors located at the top of the apparatus. Then, the stress at the tip and the displacement of the apparatus are calculated with a method based on the propagation of waves in the device. A three-dimensional numerical model of the penetration test, based on the Panda 3{\textregistered} specifications and using the discrete element method (DEM), is proposed in this paper. The purpose of the simulations is to validate the calculation method by comparing the curves of the tip stress versus the penetration distance obtained in two different ways, the first being the distance directly observed at the tip and the second being the distance calculated from the data recorded at the top of the penetrometer, as with the experimental device. The entire apparatus is represented, including the hammer, the rod, and the tip, and is driven into the model soil. The calculation method is applied, and the results are compared to the actual response of the soil to the driving of the penetrometer directly at the tip, which can be obtained with the numerical model. The responses are found to be very similar, confirming the theoretical framework and its underlying assumptions. This method is applied to dynamic penetration tests and provides the opportunity to obtain mechanical parameters other than the tip resistance from the tests.},

In order to study the feasibility of deep vibration compaction for liquefaction mitigation, a numerical model is created in the finite element framework. The methodology consisted on performing FE simulations using non-linear coupled hypoplastic model based on the u-p formulation for sand behavior at three different stages: i) analysis of seismic response and liquefaction susceptibility of untreated loose saturated sands using Lagrangian finite elements (FE); ii) simulation of the deep-vibration process by using a coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian (CLE) FE; iii) post-liquefaction susceptibility analysis of improved sands using the Lagrangian FE.},

Using molecular simulation, we also demonstrated a molecular mechanism for the effect, which is seen in a growing class of other similar materials. We have shown that this mechanism involves a premature local phase transition nucleated by local shear strain. At higher shock loads we show here that this transition becomes frustrated producing amorphous silicon.We also observe local melting below the equilibrium melt line for bulk silicon. Large-scale non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) and Hugoniostat simulations of shock compressed porous silicon are used to study the mechanism. Final stress states and strength were characterized versus initial porosity and for various porosity microstructures.},

abstract = {As a result of the difficulties related to obtaining undisturbed samples of cohesionless soils, CPT-based empirical correlations, often developed from calibration chamber experiments, are widely used for determining many soil parameters for geotechnical investigation. This paper describes the application of 19 reduced-scale calibration chamber cone penetration tests to evaluate empirical correlations for predicting the relative density, the unit weight, the constrained modulus, and the soil identification of loose to medium-dense sands. A subtraction cone, 6 mm in diameter with an apex angle of 60° and a net area ratio of 0.75, is used in the laboratory tests. Due to the fine gradation of the quartz sand used in the experiments, some of the CPT results are located within the silty sand range of the soil identification charts. An extensive evaluation is also presented for the stress normalization process of the CPT data. It is determined that a relative density-based overburden stress normalization method provided the best estimates for correcting the cone tip resistance for effective overburden stress.},

abstract = {1.3 Hopkinson type loadings In the 70's in France, G.Aussedat and J.Meunier [10] developped dynamic tests on soils (falling mass with fast filming of the crushing phase). They also performed experiments based on Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar method and well-adapted to soil testing. They designed a low impedance bar (nylon) because their first experiments on steel bars were very disappointing. Using clay specimen, these two experimental arrangements (dynamic crushing and Hopkinson bars) lead them to the following results :  crushing experiments : J.Meunier performed the analysis with fast filming of the tests. This technique allows the study of plastic wave propagation in the specimen during crushing  Hopkinson bars testing : experiments were made on very thin (1 to 10 mm) clay specimens, friction was important because the diameter of the bars is 36 mm. The only transmitted wave was taken into account in these tests, it did not allow the determination of the stress in the specimen (stress in the transmitter bar is less than 2 MPa). G.Aussedat and J.Meunier performed these experiments with and without confining pressure (from 0.2 to 0.6 MPa). From their experiments, amplitude of the transmitted wave was increasing for higher impact speeds or decreasing specimen thicknesses. However, there was no influence of the confining pressure on transmitted wave amplitude. It seems to be logical considering specimen thicknesses and values of confining pressure. Their work is one of the first to investigate dynamic response of soils with an acurate control of transient phenomena in the experimental device itself. Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar tests (SHPB) seem to be well-adapted for soils and allows a good control of wave propagation phenomena. 2. THE "CLASSICAL" S.H.P.B METHOD},

abstract = {Most developed countries in the world have large existing railway networks. Most of which are old and have been maintained and partly renewed to mainly upgrade safety, regularity, speed and load. The principal issues of the asset manager are how to prioritize maintenance/renewal works and how to provide engineering teams with reliable geotechnical data for track design on revenue service lines. Indeed, if we can master rail and sleeper specifications, railway natural trackbed remain very variable and difficult to characterize. As a matter of fact, the knowledge of mechanical and physical properties of existing subgrade and sub ballast layers is very important for the future track design. Such data can be acquired through geotechnical tests. However, the majority of classical geotechnical tests can be difficult to carry out on revenue service lines because of existing railway constraints (limited possession times, track access, no destabilization of the track.). Hence, this article presents a new methodology for railway track characterization using light and cost effective tests, based on the coupled use of the PANDA{\textregistered} dynamic penetration tests and geoendoscopy. The goal of this methodology is to provide to the asset manager key point indicator helping with the optimization of the maintenance and renewal strategy.},

abstract = {This paper presents an analytical study of the effect of the gradient in quasi-static plateau stress on the dynamic behavior of graded cellular rods under impact loading. Finite element (FE) simulations of graded hexagonal and circular cells' chains under uniaxial impact loading are first carried out by using ABAQUS/EXPLICIT to observe their dynamic deformation modes. To build an analytical model, a graded cellular rod, whose quasi-static plateau stress varies along the axial direction, is supposed to be impinged by a rigid mass G with initial velocity V0. Only one shock front appears when the gradient is positive, while two shock fronts appear in the rod with negative gradient. Analytical expressions of the dynamic response parameters for the graded cellular rod are theoretically derived by using the one-dimensional shock theory originally proposed by Reid and Peng (1997). Closed form solution is found for the single shock (SS) mode, while finite difference method is employed to obtain solutions for the double shock (DS) mode. Densification velocity, at which the graded rod is just fully crushed at the end of its dynamic response, is determined; and accordingly, the maximum energy-absorbing capacity of the graded cellular rod is determined. The weakest part of the graded rod is suggested to be placed at the impact end to achieve higher energy absorption. The theoretical models are then extended to the second scenario in which the graded cellular rod together with attached mass G impinges onto a rigid target. Similar to Scenario I, the gradient significantly influences the capacity of the graded cellular rod when the ratio of mass G to the mass of the rod is relatively small. The comparison between the FE simulation results and analytical predictions shows good agreement, which validates the theoretical model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a three-dimensional (3D) coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Finite Element Method (SPH-FEM) model, which was established to investigate pile punching and its impact on adjacent piles subjected to lateral loads. This approach handles the large distortions by avoiding mesh tangling and remeshing, contributing greatly high computational efficiency. The SPH-FEM model was validated against field measurements. The results of this study indicated that the soil type in which piles were embedded affected the interaction between piles during the pile punching. A comprehensive parametric study was carried out to evaluate the impact of soil properties on the displacement of piles due to the punching of an adjacent pile. It was found that the interaction between piles was comparatively weak when the piles were driven in stiff clays; while the pile-soil interactions were much more significant in sandy soils and soft clays.},

abstract = {This work presents a simplified approach for the nonlinear analysis of the load–displacement response of a single pile and pile groups embedded in multilayered soils. A hyperbolic model is used to capture the relationship between the skin friction and the pile–soil relative displacement developing along the pile–soil interface. The shaft displacement is assumed to be composed of the pile–soil relative displacement developing at the disturbed soil around the pile shaft and the elastic vertical soil displacement developing in the soil mass. The relationship between the shaft displacement and the skin friction is then presented. Moreover, a hyperbolic model is also used to capture the relationship between end resistance and pile end displacement. Considering the interactive effect among piles, hyperbolic models of an individual pile in pile groups are proposed. As to the analysis of the response of a single pile and pile groups, considering the progressive deformation of the pile–soil system, a highly effective iterative computer program is developed using the proposed hyperbolic models. Comparisons of the load–settlement responses demonstrate that the proposed method is generally in good agreement with the field-observed behavior and the calculated results derived from other approaches.},

Previous monotonic HSR tests have been reviewed, summarized, and combined in order to illustrate the effects of HSR loading on the confined modulus, stress-strain response, and shear strength of sand. The effects of strain rate, initial void ratio, confining pressure, saturation, shape and size of grains, as well as grain mineralogy on the response of sand to HSR loading are also discussed. Issues related to inertial effects that may affect HSR response are explored. A brief summary of the response of sand to shock loading is also presented. The review provides a comprehensive understanding of the important aspects of HSR response of sand, in support of the growing interest in the behavior of sand subject to rapid loading conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Both programs use different models and properties to simulate the mechanical behaviour of the interface between dissimilar materials. The paper describes the details of the linear elastic Mohr-Coulomb interface model available in the two software packages to model material interaction and how to select model parameters to give the same numerical outcomes. The numerical results quantitatively demonstrate the conditions that give good agreement between the two programs for the same steel strip reinforced soil-structure problem and the situations where they do not.

abstract = {To model the deep penetration process of T-bar in soft clay, an adhesive contact algorithm was developed in conjunction with the Coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian approach with consideration of the effect of strain softening. Numerical results show the simulated penetration resistance agrees well with the previous centrifuge experimental data. The failure mechanisms of the clay around the T-bar can be divided into three stages, including shallow penetration stage with global failure mechanism, partially and fully back-flow stages with local failure mechanism. Fluctuations of the penetration resistance can be explained by the formation and evolution of shear bands around the T-bar. Newly formed shear bands would intersect the previously formed shear bands in the partially back-flow stage, which results in the formation of “ear-shaped” areas rotating anticlockwise around the T-bar. The evolution of shear bands would form a similar fabric structure in the fully back-flow stage.},

abstract = {Based on the use of two different preparation procedures for reconstituting triaxial samples of sand, i.e. wet tamping and dry pluviation, significant differences in associated mechanical behaviour are observed on a reference sand with respect to the phenomenon of 'static' liquefaction. Wet tamping favours the initiation of liquefaction instability, whereas dry pluviation favours a more stable behaviour, less susceptible to liquefaction. Microscopic observation of corresponding sand specimens allows us to identify two well differentiated structures, i.e., for wet tamping, an irregular structure with predominance of aggregates (aggregated grains) and macropores, very contractant and unstable and, for dry pluviation, a more regular structure, without macropores, more dilatant and more stable. These observations show the importance of further characterization, based on the introduction of appropriate parameters, of the initial structure of sandy materials, strongly dependant upon their mode of formation (natural or artificial).

We describe the design and implementation of a low-overhead call path profiler based on stack sampling. The profiler uses a novel sample-driven strategy for collecting frequency counts for call graph edges without instrumenting every procedure's code to count them. The data structures and algorithms used are efficient enough to construct the complete calling context tree exposed during sampling. The profiler leverages information recorded by compilers for debugging or exception handling to record call path profiles even for highly-optimized code. We describe an implementation for the Tru64/Alpha platform. Experiments profiling the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite demonstrate the low (2{\%}-7{\%}) overhead of this profiler. A comparison with instrumentation-based profilers, such as gprof, shows that for call-intensive programs, our sampling-based strategy for call path profiling has over an order of magnitude lower overhead.

abstract = {Discrepancies in shear wave velocity measurements, attributed to the use of different methods to estimate travel time, for the bender element test were examined for various types of samples in this paper. A series of bender element tests using three different techniques, the time domain (TD), cross-correlation (CC), and frequency domain (FD) techniques, were performed to estimate travel times on identical specimens in triaxial or unconfined compression apparatuses. Experimental results revealed that the CC technique can provide reasonable values of the travel time by the maximum peak point for soft soils, while it is difficult to apply to sandy or artificially treated soils because of the unclear arrival point. From both, experimental investigation and numerical analysis of CC, the frequency dependence of the travel time is demonstrated. As a result of travel time estimation using frequency sweep signals, strong dispersion and scattering of phase and group velocities due to the non-linearity of the test system are indicated in the FD technique. The FD technique broadly underestimates the shear wave velocity compared with the TD technique, a trend shown in most soil samples. Shear wave velocities obtained from the CC and FD techniques are also compared with those obtained from the TD technique.},

abstract = {Tianshui City is located in a seismically active region of China. Historically, many earthquakes with magnitudes of 6.0–8.0 have been reported in this area, and most of loess–red mudstone landslides in this area are known to have been triggered by earthquakes. However, the soil dynamics under earthquakes in the Tianshui area have been little studied. Therefore, to understand the dynamic stress–strain behavior of undisturbed soils during the earthquake, cyclic and shear strength tests were conducted on soil samples (loess and weathered red mudstone) obtained from Tianshui in a cyclic triaxial test system. Two types of laboratory tests were carried out on two kinds of soils. The first type involved the tests with different cyclic stress ratios applied and the number of cycles N more than 20, while the second type are series of stress-controlled undrained reverse-shear tests. By doing so, the differences on stress condition on the behavior of Young's modulus Emax, stress–strain and shear strength were measured. In addition, tests modeling natural seismic loading were also carried out for comparative purposes. Some residual shear behaviors were also recognized. The results of a series of tests designed to study the stress–strain behavior of undisturbed soils under repeated loading are presented. These tests will provide useful parameters (e.g. $\lambda$d and Edmax) for analysis of slope stability during earthquakes and earthquake-resistant design. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Using low quality or insufficient mesh increases truncation error and diminished accuracy and using an inefficient mesh element metric (extremely fine mesh) in an optimization problem can lead to much slower than desired convergence. Therefore, mesh quality improvement is highly advised in such numerical problems. The complexity of the geometry in the mining environment limits the parameters in mesh control. In some cases avoiding low quality mesh is inevitable, which causes large error. The purpose of this paper is to develop a guideline for mesh generation and propose an optimized mesh alternative for complex geometries and the relative error of the introduced method compared to ideal mesh pattern.

In the numerical analysis, the footing and sheet pile walls were idealized as a linear elastic materials and nonlinear behaviour of soils using a Mohr–Coulomb model. The paper mainly discusses on the effect of excavations to an adjacent circular footing embedded in medium and dense sandy soil. It is observed from the results that the settlement and bending moment of the footing increases with increase in depth of an excavation. The location at which the effect of excavation on the footing is less significant as termed a safe location or critical location of the footing from excavations. The critical location of the footing based on settlement criteria is 1.5 m from an excavation faces in case of the footing in medium sand and 0.5 m in dense sand.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to introduce a method developed to calculate the dynamic penetration resistance q d from penetration tests without the need to resort to empirical or adjustment factors. From wave propagation analysis and the principles of energy conservation, it is demonstrated that in granular soils q d is conceptually the same measurement as the static cone penetration resistance q t. This hypothesis inherently considers that the damping resistance is negligible under the reference maximum velocities mobilised during in-situ test penetration. The development and validation of the proposed algorithm are achieved by direct comparisons between standard penetration test (SPT) and cone penetrometer test (CPT) data, which are the most commonly used in-situ tests. The method has produced preliminarily sounding comparisons between q t and q d in coarse-grained soils, but further research is required to validate the approach in contractive coarse-grained soils (strain hardening) and fine-grained deposits. It is concluded that a more rigorous interpretation of dynamic tests can circumvent some of the inherent limitations associated with the SPT. Used in combination, SPT and CPT give the necessary redundancy when assessing the critical parameters controlling the soil behaviour or when evaluating the potential for soil liquefaction.},

abstract = {Site characterisation and in situ test interpretation have been evolving from basic empirical recommendations to a sophisticated area demanding a thorough knowledge of material behaviour and numerical modelling. With the advent of modern testing techniques and more rigorous methods of analysis, site characterisation in natural soils is gaining momentum. This Report presents a critical appraisal in the understanding and assessment of the stress-strain-time and strength characteristics of natural soil conditions and explores new interpretation methods capable of measuring soil properties shaped by effects of microstructure, stiffness non-linearity, small and large strain anisotropy, weathering and destructuration, consolidation characteristics and rate dependency. Interpretation methods in different soil formations such as clay, sand, silt and bonded geomaterials are explored using different testing techniques. Since the in situ behaviour of natural soils is complex, a single general recommendation is to cross-correlate measurements from different tests. When data are combined there is more scope for rational interpretation and, for this reason, emphasis has been placed on correlations with mechanical properties that are based on the combination of independent measurements.},

The use of both static and dynamic results allows for an entire description of the anisotropic elastic compliance tensor at a given stress-strain state to be made. The evolutions of this tensor during triaxial loading and unloading are presented.

abstract = {A study of the assumptions involved in the ultimate bearing capacity equation indicates the shortcomings of that equation and load test data confirm these shortcomings. A new approach using a normalized load settlement curve is proposed to alleviate these shortcomings and to obtain the complete load settlement curve for a footing in sand. The normalization consists of plotting the mean footing pressure divided by a measure of the soil strength within the depth of influence of the footing versus the settlement divided by the footing width. It is shown that the normalized load settlement curve for a footing is independent of footing size and embedment. It is proposed to obtain the normalized curve point-by-point from a soil test. Because the deformation of the soil observed under full-scale footings during loading indicates a barreling effect similar to the soil deformation around a pressuremeter probe, the preboring pressuremeter curve is used to obtain the footing curve. The new method consists of transforming the preboring pressuremeter curve point-by-point into the footing load settlement curve. Load tests and numerical simulations are used to propose a method for a rectangular footing near a slope subjected to an eccentric and inclined load. The new method gives the complete load settlement curve for the footing and alleviates the problems identified with the bearing capacity equation. {\textcopyright} 2007 ASCE.},

abstract = {In geotechnical earthquake engineering, wave propagation plays a fundamental role in engineering applications related to the dynamic response of geotechnical structures and to site response analysis. However, current engineering practice is primarily concentrated on the investigation of shear wave propagation and the corresponding site response only to the horizontal components of the ground motion. Due to the repeated recent observations of strong vertical ground motions and compressional damage of engineering structures, there is an increasing need to carry out a comprehensive investigation of vertical site response and the associated compressional wave propagation, particularly when performing the seismic design for critical structures (e.g. nuclear power plants and high dams). Therefore, in this paper, the compressional wave propagation mechanism in saturated soils is investigated by employing hydro-mechanically (HM) coupled analytical and numerical methods. A HM analytical solution for compressional wave propagation is first studied based on Biot's theory, which shows the existence of two types of compressional waves (fast and slow waves) and indicates that their characteristics (i.e. wave dispersion and attenuation) are highly dependent on some key geotechnical and seismic parameters (i.e. the permeability, soil stiffness and loading frequency). The subsequent HM Finite Element (FE) study reproduces the duality of compressional waves and identifies the dominant permeability ranges for the existence of the two waves. In particular the existence of the slow compression wave is observed for a range of permeability and loading frequency that is relevant for geotechnical earthquake engineering applications. In order to account for the effects of soil permeability on compressional dynamic soil behaviour and soil properties (i.e. P-wave velocities and damping ratios), the coupled consolidation analysis is therefore recommended as the only tool capable of accurately simulating the dynamic response of geotechnical structures to vertical ground motion at intermediate transient states between undrained and drained conditions.},

The Interface model is then first tested by modelling different soil-120 120structure interface characterization shear tests, such as constant volume (CV), constant normal load (CNL) and constant normal stiffness (CNS) shear tests. Furthermore, model predictions are compared with experimental results of CNS shear tests in Toyoura sand-steel interfaces. Numerical simulations showed that the model captures very well the main features of the interface behaviour with different boundary conditions and interface roughnesses. Secondly, and finally the interface model is used to pile axial loading applications. Pile resistance is computed and compared with centrifuge test results, through shaft and base resistance load settlement curves, for different pile-soil interface conditions resulting in different stress paths.},

abstract = {The behaviour of sands and mixtures of sand/clay are investigated by the means of the prototype “T4C StaDy” developped at DGCB/ENTPE, which is an innovative torsion/compression device. Independent static and dynamic loadings can be applied to a hollow cylinder specimen and the effects of induced anisotropy, sudden or continous rotation of stress principle axes, investigated under three-dimensional stress paths. Dynamic loadings are carried out thanks to piezo-electric transducers. The measurable strain range covers very small strains (several 10-6m/m) to large strains (several 10-2m/m) with an innovative local measurement system. A comprehensive series of triaxial compression tests and torsional shear tests (from an anisotropic initial stress state) were performed including creep, small cyclic and dynamics loadings. Eight terms of the compliance tensor linking strain and stress increments can be determined under small cyclic loadings. Several properties of this tensor are reported. Inverse analysis of dynamic measurements gives also several terms of the compliance tensor. Isotropic elasticity and transverse isotropic elasticity are considered. Static and dynamic measurements show a good agreement all the more since transverse isotropic elasticity is assumed in dynamic analysis. The viscous behavior of the materials can be characterized thanks to creep strains. The proposed modelling is based on a three-component model. Small strain (non viscous) behaviour and viscous behaviour are respectively simulated by the first and the third component. Experimental static, dynamic and creep results are well predicted by the model. The first component is incorporated into field wave propagation equations (cross-hole tests on a nuclear plant site) and allow to determine overall soils and soils skeletons elastic properties under isotropic and anisotropic assumptions. Results enlighten the importance of considering anisotropic soils behaviour.},

abstract = {Mild traumatic brain injury associated with blast exposure is an important issue, and cavitation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been suggested as a potential injury mechanism; however, physical measurements are required to evaluate cavitation thresholds. Modifications to a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) apparatus were investigated with the aim to generate localized fluid cavitation and measure the cavitation threshold of fluids. The proposed design incorporated a novel closed cavitation chamber to generate localized cavitation resulting from a reflected compression pulse, which was generated by a spherical steel striker and Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) incident bar. A numerical model of the incident bar was developed and validated with 24 independent tests (cross-correlation: 0.970–0.997), and this was extended to a numerical model of the apparatus including the chamber, validated with 27 independent tests (cross-correlation: 0.921) to predict the tensile fluid pressure in the chamber. Tests on distilled water were performed with comparable numerical results for the chamber strain (R2: 0.875) and chamber end-wall velocity (R2: 0.992). The pressure in the chamber was determined from the model to avoid introducing a nucleation site via a pressure gauge, and was verified with a first-order approximation showing good agreement (R2: 0.892). The 50{\%} probability of cavitation for distilled water was −3.32 MPa ±3{\%}, comparable to values in the literature. This novel apparatus, including a closed confinement chamber integrated with a polymeric SHPB apparatus was able to create localized fluid cavitation with loading comparable to blast exposure. Future studies will include the measurement of CSF cavitation pressure.},

abstract = {Soil behavior is complex and thus requires quantification by a reasonably good number of different engineering parameters. Consequently, the seismic piezocone test (SCPTu) is particularly well- suited to being an efficient and economical tool for routine site characterization because four independ- ent readings are obtained with depth by a single sounding: qt, fs, u2, and Vs. An overview on using all four of these separate measurements for evaluating soil engineering parameters is given, realizing in some cases that redundancy occurs when two or more readings are used to interpret the same geomateri- al parameter. The assessment of parameters and subsurface information herein includes: unit weight, soil type, relative density of sands, effective stress peak friction angle, undrained shear strength, effective yield stress, and stiffness},

abstract = {A numerical analysis is presented to model the cone penetration test (CPT) tip resistance in layered soil. Analyses are performed for two-layer soils composed of either sands with different relative densities or different materials (sand and clay). Parametric numerical modeling is used to determine the distance that a cone senses a new upcoming soil layer interface or a layer interface behind. Analyses are also carried out for a thin sand layer embedded in soft clay. It is seen that the full tip resistance may not be reached in thin stiff layers. This is especially true for penetration in thin dense sand layers interbedded in softer clay. A correction factor is suggested to correct the cone tip resistance in thin sand layers. The higher the stiffness and the thinner the layer, the larger the correction factor. The numerical results obtained in this paper are in good agreement with experimental observations. Some limitations of a previously proposed correction factor are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2005 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {The data reduction method for dispersion relation in surface wave testing is conventionally associated with the certain method of data acquisition, for example, phase shift analysis in the two-station SASW method and 2-D multi-station wavefield transformation of surface wave in the MASW method. The fundamental difference in dispersion analysis between the 2-station and multi-station approach was clarified in this study. Limited to the two channel data, conventional dispersion analysis of SASW suffers from possible phase un-wrapping errors, inefficient data filtering and synthesis, and inability to distinguish multiple modes. The MASW approach, on the other hand, can avoid these problems and provide visualization of dispersion relation through 2D wavefield transformation. As opposed to multiple shots in the SASW testing, the MASW testing typically uses only single shot, limiting the obtainable wavelengths due to near field and far field effects. Combining the merits of these two methods, a multi-shot common receiver configuration survey is proposed to acquire multi-station wavefield for 2D wavefield transformation using as few as two receivers. An additional benefit of the multi-shot common receiver configuration is shown to be better control and higher lateral resolution of the measurement range.},

In this both the pile and the soil are treated as twp distinct parts of the same solid continuum, but with different properties. The behaviour of the soil medium, assumed to be semi-infinite and nonlinear, is represented by the hyperbolic stress-strain relationship. Discretizing the pile-soil system in turn by con-ventional axi-symmetric and mapped finite elem{\~{}}enta, the problem is solved in the time--in using the central difference scheme. The example considered is that of a fully embedded steel pipe pile for which both field test data and Wave Equation solution are available. Results show that: the Continuum Method is capable of a greater degree of accuracy than the conventional Wave Equation Method, but it is far more expensive than the latter in terms of cc{\~{}}tational effort needed; the effects of radiation damping and wave dispersion in the soil are found to be small; and the mapped finite elements give significantly better results than conventional el{\~{}}ments.},

A soil-structure interaction model was used for this purpose. The physical model of the structure is based on a general beam formulation. A lumped-parameter model was adopted to represent the soil and the interaction mechanisms. The seismic load was incorporated by ground acceleration records of many earthquakes. Finally, using the Correspondence Principle, the hysteretic and Voigt damping was incorporated into the soil model. Using the implemented models, a numerical study was carried out. The results obtained lead to an indirect assessment of the importance of energy dissipation due to soil material damping compared with the dissipation due to radiation damping. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Requiring 1-3. s of analysis time per blow, the algorithm provides a real time assessment of average skin friction along the pile.

In this paper, a new method with no time limits is presented for measuring the force and displacement at any station on a bar from strain or velocity measurements performed at various places on the bar. The method takes the wave dispersion into account, as must inevitably be done when making long time measurements. It can be applied to one-dimensional and single-mode waves of all kinds propagating through a medium (flexural waves in beams, acoustic waves in wave guides, etc.). With bars of usual sizes, the measuring time can be up to 50 times longer than the time available with classical methods. An analysis of the sensitivity of the results to the accuracy of the experimental data and to the quality of the wave propagation modelling was also carried out. Experimental results are given which show the efficiency of the method. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {CAPWAP(R) Provides the most reliable means of analyzing dynamic pile top
force and velocity records from the Pile Analzer(R) (PDA). This is a
signal matching approach which requires that certain soil parameters are
adjusted until measured and calculated pile top variables reach a
reasonable match. The number of unknown soil parameters depends on the
depth of pile penetration and therefore the computational effort can be
appreciable if the pile is long. The process can be either done in an
interactive manner or automatically with great time savings. Current
practice requires that the automatic results are checked by interactive
analysis.
In an attempt to make the automatic solution reliable, several
additional matching parameters have been included in the CAPWAP model.
Among these variables, the most important is the final set (inverse of
blow count) of the hammer blow analyzed. Unfortunately, since restrike
data is usually analyzed by CAPWAP for long term static capacity
predictions, final set is not always accurately known. For this reason a
study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of the automated CAPWAP
results including blow count matching compared to the traditional
approach. More than 30 cases where static load tests and restrike tests
had been performed were analyzed using the automatic procedure provided
by the Windows based CAPWAP Version 1999-1. This program also calculates
the total dynamic resistance (the sum of damping and static resistance)
allowing for an assessment of the ratio of total dynamic resistance to
static resistance and its relationship with soil type.},

We studied the influence of pore water pressure during rapid load tests and its effect on the widely used unloading point method to derive static pile capacity. This paper describes the testing programme and the test set-up. We present typical measurement results from a total of 36 rapid and 12 static load tests, as well as the effects of the loading rate and excess pore pressures on pile resistance. The tests confirm that a rapid load test can overestimate static capacity due to pore water pressure when testing piles in medium to fine sands. The results of the pore pressure measurements show a combination of positive and negative excess pore pressure in the zone around the pile base, which can be explained by compression, volumetric behaviour during shearing and pore fluid flow around the pile. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.

Le mode de travail d'une fondation et son interaction avec le sol conduisent {\`{a}} introduire la notion de profondeur critique que l'on peut d{\'{e}}finir en premi{\`{e}}re approximation comme le niveau au-dessous duquel, en sol homog{\`{e}}ne, la r{\'{e}}sistance sous la base de la fondation n'augmente plus. Les fondations superficielles ont leur base situ{\'{e}}e au-dessus de cette profondeur critique: ce sont les semelles, radiers, etc. Les fondations profondes ont leur base situ{\'{e}}e au-dessous de cette profondeur critique. Les fondations superficielles travaillent essentiellement gr{\^{a}}ce {\`{a}} la r{\'{e}}sistance du sol sous la base. Pour les fondations profondes (pieux, puits, barrettes, etc.), il y a {\'{e}}galement lieu de consid{\'{e}}rer la r{\'{e}}sistance du sol le long du f{\^{u}}t, c'est-{\`{a}}-dire le frottement lat{\'{e}}ral (cf. chapitre sp{\'{e}}cialis{\'{e}} dans ce trait{\'{e}}). Entre les deux extr{\^{e}}mes, fondations superficielles et fondations profondes, on trouve les fondations semi-profondes dont la base se trouve au-dessus de la profondeur critique, mais pour lesquelles le frottement lat{\'{e}}ral ne peut {\^{e}}tre n{\'{e}}glig{\'{e}}: il s'agit des puits et pieux courts ou des barrettes de faible profondeur et de la plupart des caissons. Il n'y a pas de m{\'{e}}thode de calcul propre {\`{a}} cette cat{\'{e}}gorie de fondations qui ne constituent que des cas particuliers; il faudra adapter, suivant les cas, les m{\'{e}}thodes retenues pour les fondations superficielles ou pour les fondations profondes.},

Para a solu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do problema de expans{\~{a}}o considerou-se que um m{\'{o}}dulo equivalente el{\'{a}}stico condiciona o fluxo, o que possibilita a obten{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de uma solu{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o fechada para as distribui{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es de poropress{\~{o}}es, tens{\~{o}}es e deforma{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es foram calculadas numericamente.

abstract = {The main objective of this paper is introducing a so-called continuum numerical model to overcome some of the limitations of the mass-spring-dashpot systems. Two continuum numerical schemes including a finite difference method (FDM) and a finite element method (FEM) are utilized. Unlike the previous continuum numerical models, the adopted models follow a signal matching procedure similar to lumped models. A real driven pile that has been carefully monitored is considered for model verification and validation, for which the dynamic and static test results, soil profile and soil characteristics are available. Among the major advantages of the model are considerations of soil inertia and/or radiation damping effects. A signal matching procedure is followed by changing the strength and deformation parameters of the soil and interface between pile-soil, both at the "End-Of-Drive" (EOD) and "Beginning of Restrike" (BOR). The results indicate a substantial increase in the soil strength parameters of the pile-shaft interface and the soil modulus below the pile tip at restrike. It is found that the effect of radiation damping significantly changes the pile-soil stiffness during pile hammering. The comparisons between FDM and FEM predictions show very good agreements. Two sets of parameters involved in signal matching are introduced for EOD and BOR signal matching analyses, to compare the variations during the soil setup process. The parameters are also compared against the in situ soil parameters acquired from soil investigation data. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.},

abstract = {Bender elements are shear wave transducers, widely used for the experimental identification of the small-strain shear moduli of geomaterials. They offer good coupling with the sample and controllable loading signal and frequency, but some of their design and signal interpretation features are still under investigation. The research of these features has been approached mainly on experimental grounds and, in most cases, the conclusions were not consensual. This study aims at laying the foundations for a coupled, numerical-experimental approach to the problem. It uses hybrid-Trefftz finite elements to model the bender element test and the output signal obtained in the laboratory to validate the model. Two main reasons justify the choice of the hybrid-Trefftz finite elements. First, hybrid-Trefftz elements are considerably less wavelength-sensitive than conforming displacement elements. This feature endorses the use of the same (coarse) mesh for modelling waves of very different types and frequencies, thus eliminating the need for time-consuming mesh refinements. Second, hybrid-Trefftz elements use physically meaningful approximation bases. This feature enables the numerical filtration of the spurious compression waves propagating laterally from the emitter and of their reflections from the envelope of the sample. Hybrid-Trefftz finite elements are shown to recover adequately the output signal obtained experimentally, for pulse excitations of various frequencies and two sets of boundary conditions. The decomposition of the output signal into its shear and compression components endorses the clear identification of the shear wave arrival and the amount of compression wave pollution.},

abstract = {The geotechnical ground investigation involves several testing techniques. Within such techniques, the Piezocone Penetration Test with seismic wave measurements (SCPTu) is one of the most popular. This test is widely used for in situ soil characterisation given its continuous measurements and repeatability. The interpretation of such test results has a strong theoretical background, namely allowing the identification the soil profile based on correlation of mechanical properties. In turn, the application of multivariate statistical methods allows identifying the soil stratigraphy by data association. This paper proposes a multivariate statistical approach, based on cluster analysis, for defining stratigraphic interfaces from SCPTu measurements. Using an extensive database from the Lower Tagus Valley region (near Lisbon, Portugal), this novel approach combines the four SCPTu parameters and recognises the association between the measurements. A comparison between statistical results against the profiles of soil behaviour index validates the efficiency of the approach, indicating a good agreement between data associations with the soil behaviour index profiles. The findings showed that the statistical procedure proposed in this study leads to reliable results for identifying soils with similar soil behaviour type.},

abstract = {Rockfall propagation models are routinely used for the quantitative assessment of rockfall hazard. Their capacities and limitations remain difficult to assess due to the limited amount of exhaustive experimental data at the slope scale. This article presents experiments of block propagation performed in a quarry located in Authume (France). This study site was chosen for its complexity, related with the presence of topographical discontinuities and of configurations promoting block rolling. A total of more than one hundred blocks were released on two propagation paths. The propagation of the blocks was assessed by measuring the block stopping points as well as their kinematics at specific locations of the paths, called evaluation screens. Significant variability of the stopping points and of the block kinematics at the evaluation screens was observed, and preferential transit and deposit zones were highlighted. The analysis of the results showed predominant effect of topography, in particular that related to topographical discontinuities. Significant influence of local and small scale parameters (e.g., block orientation, local topography) was also highlighted. These conclusions are of particular interest for researchers or practitioners who would like to assess the relevance of propagation modeling tools considering this complex study site. In this configuration, the quality of block propagation simulations should notably rely on the accuracy of digital terrain models, and on the integration of local conditions effects using physically based approaches.},

In this paper, an advanced model for dynamic pile driving analysis was used to develop accurate pile driving formulas. The proposed driving formulas are validated through well-documented case histories. Comparisons of predictions from the proposed formulas with results from static and dynamic load tests show that they produce reasonably accurate predictions of pile capacity based on pile set observations.},

abstract = {A systematic study is reported of the behaviour of graded silica sands and a silica rock flour silt, sheared against steel interfaces. Ring shear experiments investigated the influences of interface position, displacement scale, normal stress level and particle size distribution on ultimate interface friction angle, $\delta$′cv Grain crushing is shown to play an important role within a concentrated shear zone, and this process, along with changes in the roughness of the interface, could lead to $\delta$′ values markedly different from those developed in conventional small-displacement direct shear tests. It is also shown that $\delta$′ measurements at smaller displacements may depend on whether the interface is mounted above or below the sample, but that such differences diminish to zero when displacements are large. The finding that $\delta$′ is strongly displacement-dependent over the single-millimetre to multiple-metre scale has many practical geotechnical engineering implications.},

The study focuses on resonance, which has been shown to be of utmost importance for triggering liquefaction due to P-waves alone. The generalised-$\alpha$ scheme performs well, provided that the time-step has been carefully selected. Conversely, the dissipative Newmark method can excessively damp the response, changing radically the computed results. This implies that a computationally prohibiting small time-step would be required for Newmark to provide an accurate solution.},

abstract = {The paper investigates the characteristics of propagating shock waves in soil, resulting from an explosion of a cylindrical line charge. The main purpose of this investigation is to study the full locking parameter's effect on the qualitative and quantitative behavior of the peak pressure attenuation. The soil is modeled as a bulk irreversible compressible elastic plastic medium, including full bulk locking and dependence of the current deviatoric yield stress on the pressure. The Lagrange approach and the modified variational-difference methods are used to simulate the process. A study of the characteristics of the equation of the state of soil was carried out for the case of a cylindrical line charge explosion in an infinite soil medium. The computed results were compared with experimental data. It was found that the full locking model somewhat overpredicts the measured stresses. The dependence of the peak stress attenuation, during the shock wave propagation, on the full locking parameter of the equation of state was studied. When the pressure-volumetric strain relationship beyond the point of full compaction is not steep, the attenuation may be described by a power law that may be expressed as a linear relationship on a logarithmic scale. When this relationship is relatively steep however, the logarithmic dependence of the peak stress on the shock wave coordinate is close to a bilinear function. It was also shown that the shock wave peak stress parameters of this power law for the high pressure range (i.e., short distance of the wave front from the explosive charge) are linearly dependent on the full locking parameter. Also it was shown that the full compaction density affects the exponent of stress-distance power relationship only at the earlier stage of the wave propagation and only when the range of nonlinear elastic compaction is relatively narrow. {\textcopyright} 2009 ASCE.},

This shear wave propagation can explore some main characteristics of the soil mass from low-strain without causing any permanent effects. A series of triaxial tests of different sands implemented by bender element installation was performed to investigate the mechanical responses of sand samples during isotropic loadings. The results showed that this shear wave propagation technique can describe to some extent the mechanical responses on sands. Namely, the higher the effective confining stress and packing condition, the faster the shear wave velocity. This could be concluded that small void ratio results in rapid shear wave propagation. The mechanical response parameters can be correlated as an inverse straight line. The linear correlation between shear wave velocity and void ratio can be drawn.},

To verify the proposed method, first, the calculated results obtained from the proposed method were compared with those obtained from the rigorous continuum method FLAC3D, the conventional Smith method, and the theoretical solution. The calculated results obtained from the proposed method were in good agreement with those obtained from the continuum method FLAC3D. Second, static and dynamic load tests of a spun concrete pile in a construction site in Viet Nam were carried out. Wave Matching Analyses (WMAs) using the proposed method were conducted to derive a static load-displacement curve. The derived curve was comparable to that measured in static load test (SLT), indicating that the proposed method has high potential to predict the static pile response. Hence, the proposed method could be used as a practical alternative to the conventional SLT.},

The hyperbolic model is a reasonable conceptual model for representing the stress–strain behaviour of sand, but some empirical curve fitting is required to obtain a more realistic model for calculation purposes. This can readily be performed for reconstituted samples of sand using laboratory tests. Recent evidence shows that the stiffness of natural sands is often much greater than that of the same sand when reconstituted at the same density and stress state in the laboratory, and it is therefore necessary to use in situ testing methods to determine the stress–strain behaviour of such sands. In this paper, the finite element method is used to simulate pressuremeter tests in a soil modelled using a hyperbolic-type model. It concentrates on the behaviour in unload-reload loops, which are often included in pressuremeter tests to measure shear modulus. The effect on the whole unload-reload loop...},

The large displacements and large deformations involved in the cone penetration problem are tackled using the Particle Finite Element Method, especially adapted for the analysis of coupled geotechnical problems (G-PFEM). A non-local regularization technique is adopted to prevent the pathological mesh dependence associated with continuum analysis of softening materials. Brittle soil behaviour is described using the CASM constitutive model. Undrained CPTu tests are simulated for a range of soils with different degree of brittleness. Effects of permeability, partial drainage and cone roughness are also explored. The results of the analyses are assessed in terms of the interpretation and classification procedures usually applied in practice. In addition, advantage is taken of the availability of a full numerical solution to explore aspects of soil response during penetration that are not possible when only global CPTu observations are available. The full set of numerical analyses have been able to capture the essential features of the problem and to provide useful insights into the effects of brittleness on the mechanisms and results of the CPTu test.},

For testing low stiffness materials such as rubbers or low strength materials such as low density cellular solids considered primarily herein, there are many advantages to replacing the metal bars with polymer bars. An investigation of a number of aspects associated with the accuracy of SHPB testing of these materials is reported. Test data are used to provide qualitative comparisons of accuracy using different bar materials and waveseparation techniques. Sample results from SHPB tests are provided for balsa, Rohacell foam and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene. The techniques used are verified by finite-element (FE) analysis. Experimentally, the material properties of the bars are determined from impact tests in the form of a complex elastic modulus without curve fitting to a rheological model. For the simulations, a rheological model is used to define the bar properties by curve fitting to the experimentally derived properties. Wave propagation in a polymer bar owing to axial impact of a steel bearing ball is simulated. The results indicate that the strain histories can be used to determine accurately the viscoelastic properties of polymer bars. An FE model of the full viscoelastic SHPB set-up is then used to simulate tests on hyperelastic materials. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

abstract = {This paper presents the state-of-the-art of using non-destructive testing (NDT) methods based on elastic waves for the condition assessment of structural timber. Two very promising approaches based on the propagation and reflections of elastic waves are described. While the first approach uses ultrasonic echoes for the testing of wooden building elements, the second approach uses guided waves (GW) for the testing of timber pole and pile structures. The basic principle behind both approaches is that elastic waves induced in a timber structure will propagate through its material until they encounter a change in stiffness, cross-sectional area or density, at which point they will reflect back. By measuring the wave echoes, it is possible to determine geometric properties of the tested structures such as the back wall of timber elements or the underground length of timber poles or piles. In addition, the internal state of the tested structures can be assessed since damage and defects such as rot, fungi or termite attacks will cause early reflections of the elastic waves as well as it can result in changes in wave velocity, wave attenuation and wave mode conversion. In the paper, the principles and theory of using elastic wave propagation for the assessment of wooden building elements and timber pole/pile structures are described. The state-of-the-art in testing equipment and procedures is presented and detailed examples are given on the practical application of both testing approaches. Recent encouraging developments of cutting edge research are presented along with challenges for future research.},

abstract = {Surface-wave dispersion analysis is widely used in geophysics to infer a shear wave velocity model of the subsoil for a wide variety of applications. A shear-wave velocity model is obtained from the solution of an inverse problem based on the surface wave dispersive propagation in vertically heterogeneous media. The analysis can be based either on active source measurements or on seismic noise recordings. This paper discusses the most typical choices for collection and interpretation of experimental data, providing a state of the art on the different steps involved in surface wave surveys. In particular, the different strategies for processing experimental data and to solve the inverse problem are presented, along with their advantages and disadvantages. Also, some issues related to the characteristics of passive surface wave data and their use in H/V spectral ratio technique are discussed as additional information to be used independently or in conjunction with dispersion analysis. Finally, some recommendations for the use of surface wave methods are presented, while also outlining future trends in the research of this topic. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

These results allow to reproduce the failure mode observed during the column excavation, by emphasizing the need of an accurate modelling of the non-linear soil-cement material which has a significant influence on the general behaviour, unlike with "rigid" piles.},

abstract = {A numerical analysis of pile driving for tapered piles is presented in this paper. A three-dimensional finite difference analysis for tapered angle and geometry effects has been used on pile driving response of tapered piles. The simulation considers an idealization for pile-soil system in drivability. The vertical pile is assumed to have linear and elastic behavior. It is also assumed that the soil is elasto-plastic material and its failure stage is controlled using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. At the soil-pile contact surfaces along the pile shaft and pile toe, slip is allowed to occur during the driving procedure using interface elements. Quiet boundaries are used to prevent waves traveling in the lateral and vertical directions for the soil. Cylindrical, fully tapered, and semi-tapered piles were analyzed. The results obtained from numerical analyses were compared with those obtained from available laboratory tests and also other available numerical data, resulting in a satisfactory agreement. The results have shown that among piles of the same length and material volume, with increasing the taper angle from zero (representing a cylindrical pile), the driving stresses decrease and the permanent pile toe settlement (set) increases. These are interesting in pile driving and are on the safe side for driven piles and increasing the driving efficiency. It has also been found that the geometry of the pile can generally influence the pile drivability. Generally speaking, tapered and partially tapered piles offer better drivability performance than cylindrical piles of the same volume and length. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The proposed methodology allies the dimensional equation technique ($\pi$ numbers) with a numerical simulation routine that is able to reproduce the dynamic test response for a SPT or for any other dynamically driven device such as LPT (Lobo, 2007). The numerical routine models the dynamic reaction mechanism, predicting the SPT penetration or blow count N. Based on typical resistance and rigidity values of cohesionless soils, an analytical solution is proposed to assess the effective friction angle. The results have proven it possible to model the penetration mechanism and, as a consequence, to use a dynamic test as an inverse boundary value problem to assess soil properties in granular materials. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOS Press.},

The aim is to achieve in-situ comparative tests to study the relationship between the results obtained with this new measurement technique (elastic modulus, wave velocity, dynamic cone resistance) and those proposed by other classical geotechnical techniques (CPTu, PMT, MASW ...). The results show the potential and interest of this new investigation technique for the characterization of surface soil (depth less than 7 m). Likewise, we find that the response of the load-penetration curve may vary depending on the conditions of the inspected ground (nature, compactness ...).

The method is an extension of that developed by Lundberg and Henchoz for uniform rods. Theoretical results, based on one-dimensional elastic wave theory, are provided for the general case as well as for cases of piecewise constant characteristic impedance. Experimental tests with different configurations of non-uniform rods and strain gauges show that the normal force histories determined at E with the present method (from measured strains at A and B) agree well with those obtained through direct strain measurement at E. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

The velocity in partially saturated sand is essentially the same as in dry sand, which confirms the analytical result of the Biot–Gassmann theory. At 100{\%} satura- tion, the velocity largely exceeds that in dry and par- tially saturated sand, once again in accordance with the Biot–Gassmann theory. However, the theory under- predicts velocities by up to 12{\%} in some cases at full saturation. The maximum attenuation determined from spectral analysis of the measured signals closely matches the characteristic frequency predicted by the Biot model.},

@article{Li2019,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers. To estimate the factor of safety of soil slopes, the discretization technique is widely used to generate the critical slip surface under the linear Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. However, the strength envelope of almost all soils has the nature of nonlinearity. This study develops a novel approach to calculate the factor of safety of soil slopes when the soil strength follows the nonlinear yield criterion. First, the numerical simulation is used to obtain the magnitude and the coordinate of minor principal stress. Then, the equivalent strength parameters are calculated by combining with the nonlinear failure criterion. Finally, slip surface is generated by the discretization technique and the factor of safety is derived on the basis of the upper bound theorem. The elastic stress analysis method of numerical simulation is used to obtain the stress distribution, and its validity is demonstrated by comparing the results derived from the elastic stress analysis and those from the elastic-plastic stress analysis. To further show the validity of the proposed method, the presented results are compared with those using GEOSLOPE software, which is a limit equilibrium method, and with those of previously published results. Based on the comparisons, the proposed method is an effective technique to calculate the factor of safety of soil slope under the condition of nonlinear failure criterion. The examples indicate that the proposed method has potential applicability in obtaining the stability of slope in layered soils.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the dynamic properties of the soil is of great importance as the dynamic shear modulus and damping ratio are necessary input data in finite element modeling programs. This paper presents a post-processing strategy to identify the shear modulus and damping ratio vs. shear strain curves using the experimental results of a dynamic centrifuge program. Application is presented for the Fontainebleau sand. The proposed methodology is fast, robust and able to capture the nonlinear hysteretic behavior of the material. Based on the results, specific parameters for the Fontainebleau sand are identified for the empirical equation of shear modulus and damping ratio proposed by Ishibashi and Zhang [1]. It is found that confining pressure has an important influence on both shear modulus evolution and damping ratio. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The soil is assumed to be an elastic - perfectly plastic material following the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. Analyses are performed for a single pile, assuming no interaction with any neighboring piles. The FE results reveal that the limit pile lateral resistance is directly proportional to the initial horizontal effective stress and the tangent of the friction angle. Moreover, the pile resistance can be estimated by simple superposition of the contributions of the cohesion and the friction angle. Based on the numerical results, a simple equation is proposed for the estimation of the pile lateral resistance in non-dilative soils. {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

It is demonstrated that at low fines contents, sand properties have a significant impact on the dynamic behavior of the soil; however, the silt inclusion is the predominant feature controlling Young's modulus beyond a specific proportion of fines content. Based on the flexural resonant column tests performed on the sand-silt mixture specimens with variable parent sand materials in terms of uniformity coefficient and particle shape, a new expression is established for the evaluation of the small-strain dynamic Young's modulus of silty sands using the concept of equivalent granular void ratio. Having a typical micromechanical discussion, the influence of confining pressure, particle shape, and fines content on the small-strain stiffness of sand-silt mixtures are thoroughly described. Furthermore, invoking the theory of elasticity, the variation of Poisson's ratio with fines content for sand-silt mixtures is discussed.},

The results are applicable to both saturated and unsaturated soils, a variety of cross-sectional shapes, and a wide range of embedment depths and types of contact between the vertical sidewalls and the surrounding soil.

It is shown, however, that it is sufficiently accurate for general expansion problems not obeying plane-strain rotationally (or spherically) symmetric conditions and involving strain-hardening/softening constitutive behaviour. Therefore, this relationship quantifies the error stemming from the computational assumption of small deformations and provides a simple and efficient way of accounting for geometric non-linearity based entirely on conventional computational methods: 'self-correction' of small strain analyses results.},

The recent technological developments made on the light dynamic penetration test Panda 3 {\textregistered} provide a dynamic load-penetration curve $\sigma$ p - s p for each impact. This curve is influenced by the mechanical and physical properties of the investigated granular media. In order to analyze and exploit the load-penetration curve, a numerical model of penetration test using 3D Discrete Element Method is proposed for reproducing tests in dynamic conditions in granular media. All parameters of impact used in this model have at first been calibrated by respecting mechanical and geometrical properties of the hammer and the rod. There is a good agreement between experimental results and the ones obtained from simulations in 2D or 3D. After creating a sample, we will simulate the Panda 3 {\textregistered}. It is possible to measure directly the dynamic load-penetration curve occurring at the tip for each impact. Using the force and acceleration measured in the top part of the rod, it is possible to separate the incident and reflected waves and then calculate the tip's load-penetration curve. The load-penetration curve obtained is qualitatively similar with that obtained by experimental tests. In addition, the frequency analysis of the measured signals present also a good compliance with that measured in reality when the tip resistance is qualitatively similar.},

abstract = {The method of stress characteristics has been employed to compute the end-bearing capacity of driven piles. The dependency of the soil internal friction angle on the stress level has been incorporated to achieve more realistic predictions for the end-bearing capacity of piles. The validity of the assumption of the superposition principle while using the bearing capacity equation based on soil plasticity concepts, when applied to deep foundations, has been examined. Fourteen pile case histories were compiled with cone penetration tests (CPT) performed in the vicinity of different pile locations. The end-bearing capacity of the piles was computed using different methods, namely, static analysis, effective stress approach, direct CPT, and the proposed approach. The comparison between predictions made by different methods and measured records shows that the stress-level-based method of stress characteristics compares better with experimental data. Finally, the end-bearing capacity of driven piles in sand was expressed in terms of a general expression with the addition of a new factor that accounts for different factors contributing to the bearing capacity. The influence of the soil nonassociative flow rule has also been included to achieve more realistic results.},

abstract = {Results obtained by SASW and PS-logging (in-hole) seismic techniques are compared with the relatively new ReMi (Refraction microtremor) method at a common site with a well-known soil profile: a recently constructed high-speed railway embankment. PS-logging is the most accurate technique in identifying the soil profile of the embankment followed by Re-Mi and SASW. Mean shear wave velocity estimations are also higher for PS-logging, followed by SASW and ReMi, while mean deviation is similar in each technique. The ReMi technique has provided very accurate results in the study of the embankment profile, which in addition to its high operability and its fast data processing, makes it a very convenient technique for extensive geotechnical surveys. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Displacement finite element analysis is performed for a cone-penetration test in cohesionless soils. By modelling finite strain in the soil and large scale sliding at the penetrometer-soil interface, a more realistic penetration process is simulated in which the penetrometer is assumed to be rigid and the soil is assumed to be an elastic-perfect-plastic continuum obeying the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. The cone resistance found from the calculations shows that the depth of steady-state penetration depends on the stress state and the soil properties. Parametric studies are performed to illustrate the influence of various factors on the cone resistance at the steady state. The deformation mode of the soil around the cone, as well as the plastic zone, is shown to be similar to that caused by cavity expansion. Indeed, the calculated cone resistances are comparable with empirical correlations based on cavity-expansion theory. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Inclined-mirror Hugoniot measurements of yttria (Y,Osj -doped (9.6 and 8.0 mol {\%}) cubic zirconia single crystal and polycrystal were performed in the pressure range up to I20 GPa to study yielding and phase transition. The Hugoniot-elastic limit (HEL) stresses parallel to the (100) and (1 IO) axes were approximately 14 and 25 GPa, respectively, while that of the polycrystal was approximately 13 GPa. Above the HELs the Hugoniot data parallel toward the (100) and (110) axes converged on each other, and showed large relief to an isotropic compression state, while those of the polycrystal preserved a considerably larger shear strength. A phase transformation took place at approximately 53 GPa (both (100) and (110) axis directions), and was completed by about 70 GPa. The phase transition pressure was much higher than those of the monoclinic- or tetragonal-orthorhombic II phase transitions under static compression. The shock velocity U, versus particle velocity Up relation of the final phase of the single crystal was given by U, = 2.19 + 2.3 5 Up km/s. The equation of state of the final phase was analyzed by using a program based on the Debye model, the Mie-Griineisen equation, and the Birch-Murnaghan equation. The volume change between the cubic phase and the final phase at zero pressure was estimated to be 20{\%}, which was larger than that expected for the cubic-orthorhombic II transition. The bulk moduli of the final phase at zero pressure were estimated to be 510 GPa.},

However, correct numerical simulation of pile driving process to credibly predict the ground vibrations has been the main problem to date. Hence, to significantly improve the predictions of ground vibrations, a continuous pile driving model from the ground surface to final installation depth, unlike previous common discontinuous pile driving, was employed using an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) adaptive mesh method, accurate simulation of the pile-soil interaction, and elimination of previous researchers simplified assumptions. The results were verified with field measurements which indicate a remarkably better match compared to the previous numerical studies. Moreover, an elastic pile consideration rather than rigid conditions was led to a better consistency of the ground vibration results with field measurements.},

Based on the experimental results, a simple model is developed to predict the shapes and locations of failure surfaces in the soil. These are determined as a function of the depth of the soil, the angle of dilation for the soil, and the dip angle of the fault. The conditions for development of a graben structure, as observed during normal movement on the bedrock fault, are also determined. The emphasis of the study is on the mechanics of deformation and failure in cohesionless soil above dip‐slip faults in relation to principles of soil mechanics.

For these tests both time and frequency domain analyses were performed. Resonant column tests were also performed on the same sand to validate the results obtained with the bender elements and accelerometers setup. As is well known, in the last decades the development of new laboratory techniques to assess soil stiffness through the use of seismic wave-based techniques, has received significant attention due to its simplicity and versatility of the equipment setup. One of these techniques is the bender elements test which have been one of the most widely used, although some limitations concerning its usage. In this context, the combined use of bender elements with other seismic wave-based testing techniques, such as accelerometers or the resonant column, is quite important to compare and validate the testing techniques. Given its miniature size, the installation of accelerometers on the side of the sample is considered feasible without significant disturbance on the other measuring techniques. The resonant column is a widely used and accurate testing technique due to its reliability and repeatability. Finally, the results of this combined tests allow a critical discussion on the advantages and limitations of the use of bender elements and accelerometers, in contrast with the resonant-column for the assessment of the shear modulus in sand.},

abstract = {The characteristics of hydrocarbon-contaminated soils have been among major concerns of geotechnical engineers due to its significant frequency of event and also its influential consequences on our surroundings from various environmental and engineering viewpoints. Heretofore, the effects of diverse kinds of hydrocarbon contaminants on majority of geotechnical properties of fine- and coarse-grained soils such as grain size, hydraulic conductivity, plasticity, compressibility, internal friction, cohesion, and shear strength have been investigated. However, there has not been a concentrated research study examining shear wave velocity (V s) of hydrocarbon-contaminated soils as an important geotechnical property of soil due to this fact that, in small/very small strain levels, the maximum shear modulus of soils (G max) can be determined using shear wave velocity (Gmax=$\rho$Vs2). This paper aims to investigate effects of hydrocarbon contamination on shear wave velocity of sandy soils by comparing shear wave velocities in identically prepared clean and contaminated samples. To this aim, an Iranian light crude oil, a standard type of silica sand (Ottawa sand), and a bender element apparatus were used to minutely measure shear wave velocity of clean and crude oil contaminated sand samples. Moreover, dry and quasi-moist tamping methods were employed in order to provide comparable clean and contaminated specimens (containing 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 wt{\%} of crude oil), respectively. Firstly, a comprehensive bender element (BE) and resonant column tests were conducted on the identically prepared clean sand samples at various amounts of frequency (2–20 kHz) and under various confining pressure (50–500 kPa) to find the best methods of accurately determining shear wave travel time in BE tests. Thereafter, BE tests were conducted to examine shear wave velocity in contaminated specimens. Based on the results, it was found that there was a critical value for crude oil content with the maximum shear wave velocity so that shear wave velocity of 4 wt{\%} contaminated sand (Vs-4 wt{\%}) was about 1.2 times higher than clean one (Vs-clean), and contrastingly adding further crude oil up to 6 wt{\%} made a significant reduction in value of shear wave velocity to some extent that Vs-6 wt{\%} was slightly lower than Vs-clean (Vs-6 wt{\%} = 0.95–0.97Vs-clean). Moreover, adding more contaminant (8–12 wt{\%}) into sand had negligible influences on shear wave velocity. In this paper, the effects of crude oil contamination on sand microstructure were also evaluated using scanning electron microscopy.},

The largest drop occurs for vertical effective stresses between 4 kPa and 50 kPa and varies between 4° and 10° depending mostly on the shape of the sand particles and the difference in the extreme void ratios.},

These changes$\backslash$nare considered to be an important cause of the rapid decline in farmland$\backslash$nbiodiversity, with the remaining biodiversity concentrated in field$\backslash$nedges and non-crop habitats. The simplification of landscape composition$\backslash$nand the decline of biodiversity may affect the functioning of natural$\backslash$npest control because non-crop habitats provide requisites for a broad$\backslash$nspectrum of natural enemies, and the exchange of natural enemies between$\backslash$ncrop and non-crop habitats is likely to be diminished in landscapes$\backslash$ndominated by arable cropland. In this review, we test the hypothesis$\backslash$nthat natural pest control is enhanced in complex patchy landscapes with$\backslash$na high proportion of non-crop habitats as compared to simple large-scale$\backslash$nlandscapes with little associated non-crop habitat. In 74$\backslash${\%} and 45$\backslash${\%} of$\backslash$nthe studies reviewed, respectively, natural enemy populations were$\backslash$nhigher and pest pressure lower in complex landscapes versus simple$\backslash$nlandscapes. Landscape-driven pest suppression may result in lower crop$\backslash$ninjury, although this has rarely been documented.

abstract = {With an annual production of more than 20 billion tons a year, concrete continues to be the world's dominating manufacturing material for a foreseeable future. However, this ubiquity comes with a large ecological price as concrete stands as the third largest culprit to the torrent of CO2 after transportation and electricity generation. Despite several decades of studies, fundamental questions are still unsettled on the structure and properties of the smallest building block of concrete, Calcium- Silicate-Hydrate (C-S-H). Given the variable stoichiometry and morphology of C-S-H, no accurate models were ever developed that could link electronic information at one end to the C-S-H molecular properties at the other end. This thesis develops a new modeling toolbox that enables unraveling the interplay between structure, composition, morphology and mechanical properties of this "liquid stone" gel. First, using ab-initio calculations we characterize the structural and mechanical properties of several mineral analogs of CS- H (tobermorite family and jennite). We show tobermorite as a class of layered materials that unlike the common intuition, is not softest along the interlayer direction. Instead, the mechanically softest directions are two inclined regions forming a hinge mechanism. This feature sheds light on the complex mechanics of the realistic C-S-H layers. It occurs when the electrostatic interlayer interactions become comparable to the iono-covalent intralayer interactions. Next, to pass information to the next hierarchical level, we start by benchmarking the predictive capabilities of two commonly used force field potentials for C-S-H minerals against ab-initio calculations. While both potentials seem to give structural properties in reasonable agreement with the ab-initio results, the higher order properties such as elastic constants are more discriminating in comparing potentials with regards to predicting mechanical properties. Based on this finding, we use ab-initio structural and elasticity data in tandem to develop a new force field potential, CSH-FF, well customized and substantiated for the C-S-H family. This simple, yet efficient force-field is used in conjunction with statistical mechanics to analyze a series of molecular C-S-H models. Our simulation results predict a range of compositions and corresponding mechanical properties of solid C-S-H molecules that are consistent with real cement paste samples. This confirms our bottom-up multiscale approach with the model parameters linked to electronic structure calculations. The combination of these techniques and findings paves a path toward a predictive computational design strategy to improve the core properties of cement hydrate while reducing its negative environmental impact.},

abstract = {The underlying mechanisms governing the behaviour of displacement piles in sand are not well understood, leading to unreliability in design methods. A series of plane-strain calibration chamber tests has been conducted in order to quantify the penetration mechanism around the pile tip, and the response of the interface layer adjacent to the shaft during further penetration. A series of eight tests is reported, examining the influence of soil type, initial state, pile breadth and the use of a driving shoe. A novel image-based deformation measurement technique has been used to observe the displacement and strain paths, which are found to be relatively independent of soil type. The measured strain paths are similar to predictions made by the strain path method, and contrast sharply with assumptions implicit in cavity expansion solutions. An interface zone adjacent to the pile shaft comprising fine broken soil particles was observed to contract while shearing along the pile–soil interface. This mechanism offers an explanation for the degradation of shaft friction at a given soil horizon with increased pile penetration (‘friction fatigue'), and a subsequent recovery of capacity over time (‘set-up').},

The sand specimen confined in a hardened steel tube, had a dry density of 1.50 g/cm3 with moisture contents varied from 3{\%} to 20{\%} by weight. Experimental results indicate that partially saturated sand is more compressible than dry sand with the softest behavior observed at 7{\%} moisture content. The softening of the partially saturated sand may occur due to the pore water acting as a lubricant between the sand particles.

This paper illustrates the role of sand ratio on swelling pressure and hydraulic conductivity of the bentonite-sand mixture. Swelling pressure tests were conducted for different sand ratios such as 75, 70, 60 and 50{\%}. Similarly, compaction tests were conducted to determine the optimum moisture content and maximum dry density of bentonite-sand mixtures, for the sand ratio of 90, 80, 75, 70, 60 and 50{\%}. The hydraulic conductivity of the bentonite-sand mixtures was found out by using falling head method. The hydraulic conductivity values range from 7×10-6 to 1.6×10-10 m/s for the sand ratios of 90 and 50{\%}, respectively. In order to compare the falling head test results, hydraulic conductivity of the speci- mens was calculated indirectly from a series of consolidation tests. The hydraulic conductivity values deter- mined from both series of tests were found to be similar. The study was suggested that the most effective sand ratio of Indian barmer bentonite-sand mixtures, should not be more than 60{\%}},

abstract = {Two dimensional (2D) plane strain analyses of a large underground structure were employed to compare the performance of three boundary conditions applied at the lateral sides of the mesh. The examined boundary conditions aimed to model the far-field response. To check their adequacy, the response between the structure and the lateral boundaries of the mesh is compared with the free-field response computed with both the one-dimensional site response software EERA, developed by Bardet et al (2000), and with a 1D finite element (FE) model. The first set of analyses computed with the standard viscous boundary of Lysmer and Kuhlemeyer (1969) failed to reproduce the free-field response, while the predicted motion in the vicinity of the structure was seriously damped. The 2D analysis was then repeated using the tied degrees of freedom (TDOF) boundary condition, introduced by Zienkiewicz et al (1988), along the sides of the mesh. It is shown that the TDOF boundary condition can perfectly model the one-dimensional soil response in cases that waves radiating away from the structure towards the boundaries of the mesh are negligible or sufficiently damped. Finally, the last set of analyses employed the Domain Reduction Method of Bielak et al (2003) in conjunction with the standard viscous boundary. In this method the seismic excitation is directly introduced into the computational domain and an artificial boundary is needed only to absorb the scattered energy of the system. It is shown that when the DRM is used as a boundary condition the free-field response is recovered away from the structure and the viscous boundary can successfully absorb the scattered energy.},

abstract = {Static loading tests have traditionally been performed to determine the characteristics of pile load-movement relationships. Due to the expense involved and time required, this type of testing is performed on only selected piles on a very limited basis. Lower cost and speed of testing make dynamic pile testing according to the Case Method particularly attractive. These tests allow for an evaluation of the hammer-pile-soil system including pile static bearing capacity. Dynamic data may be further analyzed by the CAPWAP Method to evaluate soil resistance distribution and predict pile load-movement relationship under static loading conditions. This paper presents a general description of CAPWAP and its extended soil model which was most recently introduced by the authors. This soil model allows separation of static from dynamic resistance components such that a static load-set analysis from dynamic measurements becomes possible. Three case studies demonstrate this capability for different hammer, pile and soil conditions. In all three cases, both dynamic measurements and static loading tests were performed. It is concluded that dynamic testing not only can closely predict the pile static capacity, but also the relationship between applied static loads and corresponding pile movements. However, there are minimum requirements for high quality tests which can be expected to yield good correlations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mechanical analogue which models the response of a rigid circular footing on an ideal elastoplastic half‐space to transient loads. In the rational analysis of pile‐driving dynamics, the response of soil at the base of a pile is often approximated by a footing on a semi‐infinite half‐space. Most existing base models employ the well‐known Lysmer analogue to model the elastic response of the soil at the pile base, and account for the inelastic soil behaviour through the inclusion of a plastic slider with a slip load equal to the ultimate failure load of the footing. The improved model provides a force response which is significantly closer to the ideal response than existing models. The paper commences with a review of analytical solutions for the dynamic response of a rigid circular footing on an elastic half‐space. Existing mechanical analogs for the system are reviewed, and an automatic matching process proposed which improves the accuracy of the analogs under transient loading. The inelastic response is then studied using the finite element method, and the mechanical analogs are modified to allow representation of the observed inelastic behaviour. Examples are presented illustrating close agreement between the proposed models and finite element analyses for a range of Poisson's ratio. The improved models have direct application for one‐dimensional models of pile driving, particularly in the back‐analysis of data from dynamic testing of piles. They are also applicable to studies of dynamic compaction. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd},

The model was also compared with soil behaviors under creep and stress relaxation with good agreement. However, the model was unable to represent tertiary creep where strain softening became significant. The model was subsequently integrated into LS-DYNA for finite-element simulations of high strain rate behaviors of sandy and clayey soils in explosive tests. The significance of strain rate effect on the soil responses is presented herein.

abstract = {The lecture attempts to highlight the insights late Victor De Mello provided on some key areas. Considering the increasing role of the geophysical methods in the geotechnical site characterization, the writer focuses on the use of in-hole geophysical methods when assessing, both in field and in laboratory, the parameters depicting the soil state and its stiffness at small strain. With this aim the writer draws the attention to seismic transversal (S) and longitudinal (P) body waves generated both in field, during in-hole tests, and in laboratory using piezocristals. Within this framework the following issues are discussed: • Stiffness at very small strain as obtainable from the S and P velocities. • Difference between fully from near to saturated soils from the measured P-wave velocity. • Evaluation of undisturbed samples quality based on the comparison of S-waves velocities measured in field and in labo- ratory respectively. • Evaluation of porosity and void ratio from measured P and S waves velocity. • S-wave based evaluation of the coarse grained soils susceptibility to cyclic liquefaction. Keywords: seismic body waves, stiffness, fully and near to saturated state, porosity, liquefaction.},

abstract = {Demanding a thorough knowledge of material behaviour and numerical modelling, site characterization and in situ test interpretation are no longer just basic empirical recommendations. Giving a critical appraisal in the understanding and assessment of the stress-strain-time and strength characteristics of geomaterials, this book explores new interpretation methods for measuring properties of a variety of soil formations. Emphasis is given to the five most commonly encountered in situ test techniques: • standard penetration tests • cone penetration tests • vane test • pressuremeter tests • dilatometer tests. Ideal for practising engineers in the fields of geomechanics and environmental engineering, this book solves numerous common problems in site characterization. It is also a valuable companion for students coming to the end of their engineering courses and looking to work in this sector.},

abstract = {A simplified approach for nonlinear analysis of the load-displacement response of a single pile and a pile group is presented using the load-transfer approach. A hyperbolic model is used to capture the relationship between unit skin friction and pile-soil relative displacement developed at the pile-soil interface and the load-displacement relationship developed at the pile end. As to the nonlinear analysis of the single pile response, a highly effective iterative computer program is developed using the proposed hyperbolic model. Furthermore, determinations of the parameters related to the hyperbolic model of an individual pile in a pile group are obtained considering interactions between piles. Based on the determinations of the parameters presented in the hyperbolic model of an individual pile in a pile group and the proposed iterative computer program developed for the analysis of the single pile response, the conventional load-transfer approach can then be extended to the analysis of the load-settlement response of an arbitrary pile in a pile group. Comparisons of the load-settlement response demonstrate that the proposed method is generally in good agreement with the field-observed behavior and the calculated results derived from other approaches.},

abstract = {Shear strength parameters of soils C and $\phi$ can be determined by means of laboratory tests and in situ testing data. Common approaches for determination of soil strength parameters from CPT data are on the basis of bearing capacity and cavity expansion theories. A new method is proposed for C, $\phi$ prediction using all quantities, qc, u2 and fs from CPTu considering bearing capacity mechanism of failure at cone tip and direct shear failure along the penetrometer sleeve. One advantage of this method is the improvement of accuracy in the case of erroneous data using all three outputs of CPTu. Laboratory test results, two sets of nonlinear equations by the proposed approach, and existing correlations of C and $\phi$ angle parameters have been compared by applying them on a data base compiled from six sources. In current methods, cohesive parameters are not considered in bearing capacity equation and they cause the failure loads to be transferred to the second part of the basic bearing capacity equation which is a function of the internal friction angel. It has been considered that the internal friction angle obtained by current methods is relatively higher than the measured values. Also, the comparison of predicted and measured C and $\phi$ angle values indicates good consistency and low scatter for the proposed method. Accordingly, this can lead to optimize design for geotechnical practice. {\textcopyright} 2014 King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.},

@article{Randolph2003,
abstract = {Scientific approaches to pile design have advanced enormously in recent decades and yet, still, the most fundamental aspect of pile design-that of estimating the axial capacity-relies heavily upon empirical correlations. Improvements have been made in identifying the processes that occur within the critical zone of soil immediately surrounding the pile, but quantification of the changes in stress and fabric is not straightforward. This paper addresses the degree of confidence we can now place (a) on the conceptual and analytical frameworks for estimating pile capacity, and (b) on the quantitative parameters required to achieve a design. The discussion is restricted to driven piles in clays and siliceous sands, with particular attention given to extrapolating from design approaches derived for closed-ended piles of relatively small diameter to the large-diameter open-ended piles that are used routinely in the offshore industry. From a practical viewpoint, we need design approaches that minimise sensitivity to the estimated pile capacity. This may be achieved partly through a greater reliance on pile load testing, where significant advances have been made in the last decade, but also by adopting design approaches that are focused more on guarding against unacceptable deformation of the complete foundation. Example applications in the paper are drawn both from offshore applications, where current challenges include estimating the axial capacity of ultra-thin-walled, large-diameter caissons, and from onshore applications such as bridge piers and piled raft foundations, where inelastic displacement of the piles is not only acceptable, but often essential for efficient design.},

abstract = {Understanding the behavior of near equi-atomic NiTi alloys under high strain rates and high pressures is important for the development of shock mitigating structures, particularly those that protect satellite and space vehicles from the impact of hyper velocity space debris. In this paper, the equation of state and constitutive relationships of NiTi alloy at pressures of 20–50 GPa and strain rates from 104s−1 to 107s−1 were investigated by means of magnetically driven quasi-isentropic compression and by shock compression from the impact of magnetically launched flyer plates. An inflection point at a pressure of 2–3 GPa was found on plots of Lagrangian sound speed versus particle velocity in both quasi-isentropic and shock compression experiments, and it shows the elastic-plastic transition of austenitic NiTi alloy. The effect of the strain rate on the elastic limit of NiTi alloy was clearly seen between strain rates of 104s−1 and 107s−1. We also found that the bulk sound speed calculated from the shock data was lower than that deduced from the ultrasonic measurements. Finally, a rate dependent Johnson–Cook model was modified to describe the dynamic responses of NiTi. With this modified model, hydrodynamic simulations agreed well with our observations.},

Coupled-consolidation finite-element analyses, which accounted for large deformation and finite sliding effects, were carried out using Abaqus/Standard v6.6 at various rates of cone penetration. The model assumed a smooth soil/cone interface, with the soil idealised as a homogeneous elastic-perfectly plastic material obeying a nondilatant Drucker-Prager yield criterion. The results for the limiting undrained and drained conditions are compared with published strain path and cone factor solutions. The significant advance of this work is the establishment of the theoretical backbone curves arising from the effects of partial consolidation during cone penetration. The factors affecting the backbone curves are examined, and a simplified procedure for deriving these curves is proposed using a hyperbolic fit. An example is then presented to illustrate how the data from measured field cone tests performed at different penetration rates may be used to estimate the strength, deformation and consolidation characteristics of a soil.},

To perform accurate numerical investigations by the finite differences or finite element method, one must consider a specific problem known as the numerical dispersion of waves. Numerical dispersion may increase the numerical error during the propagation process as the wave velocity (phase and group) depends on the features of the numerical model. In this paper, the numerical modelling of wave propagation by the finite element method is thus analyzed and dis-cussed for linear constitutive laws. Numerical dispersion is analyzed herein through 1D computations investigating the accuracy of higher order 15-node finite elements towards numerical dispersion. Concerning the numerical analy-sis of wave attenuation, a rheological interpretation of the classical Rayleigh assumption has for instance been previously proposed in this journal.},

abstract = {Static and dynamic probes are commonly used performing engineering geological investigations in Lithuania. Due to their peculiarities, static cone penetration tests (CPTu) are most suitable for penetration of relatively weak soils. In case of deeper soil layers covered with strong soils was investigated Dynamic penetration test (DPT) is the only that could be used. In Lithuania, the most common bearing strata of foundation are glacigenic and alluvial deposits of Pleistocene age. Geotechnical properties of separate strata may differ significantly. Despite the fact, that the dynamic probing is a relatively cheap comparing with CPT investigation method, it has some significant disadvantages. The main disadvantage of reliability of DPT test results is related with transfer of driving energy through the drive rods to the cone tip. Three tests with attached sensors to the rod were performed in layered geological strata to obtain energy transfer parameters. CPT test was done after DPT for obtaining soil stratification and geotechnical soil properties promiscuity at a distance of 1.5 m. The field tests were performed at a site that is located in northeast part of Vilnius, near the complex of buildings of Vilnius Gediminas Technical University in Saulėtekis district. From geological point of view this part of Vilnius is stratified of glacigenic deposits. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Shear wave velocity-depth information is required for predicting the ground motion response to earthquakes in areas where significant soil cover exists over firm bedrock. Rather than estimating this critical parameter, it can be reliably measured using a suite of surface (non-invasive) and downhole (invasive) seismic methods. Shear wave velocities from surface measurements can be obtained using SH refraction techniques. Array lengths as large as 1000 m and depth of penetration to 250 m have been achieved in some areas. High resolution shear wave reflection techniques utilizing the common midpoint method can delineate the overburden-bedrock surface as well as reflecting boundaries within the overburden. Reflection data can also be used to obtain direct estimates of fundamental site periods from shear wave reflections without the requirement of measuring average shear wave velocity and total thickness of unconsolidated overburden above the bedrock surface. Accurate measurements of vertical shear wave velocities can be obtained using a seismic cone penetrometer in soft sediments, or with a well-locked geophone array in a borehole. Examples from thick soil sites in Canada demonstrate the type of shear wave velocity information that can be obtained with these geophysical techniques, and show how these data can be used to provide a first look at predicted ground motion response for thick soil sites. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Potentially, a seabed may be characterized rapidly and economically by using dynamically installed free-falling penetrometers (FFPs). Because of their relatively rapid deployment and recovery, FFPs may be preferred over conventional full-flow or cone penetrometers for characterizing seabeds. However, despite several successful field trials of FFPs, significant uncertainty still exists about the data interpretation, mainly because of the fast nature of the penetration process, during which regions of the soil body close to the penetrometer experience very high strain rates. The consequence of such high strain rates on pore pressure measurement is not well known. Furthermore, the rigorous numerical analysis of the problem is notoriously difficult because it involves large deformations, dynamics, hydrodynamic coupling, highly nonlinear material behavior, rate dependency, and contact mechanics. A finite-element procedure was developed and used in this study to provide a dynamic coupled solution for the penetrometer impact and burial into saturated clay. Subsequently, some mechanisms involved in the generation of excess pore pressures were investigated with specific attention given to the effects of the penetrometer tip geometry and the location of the pore pressure measuring devices. An important numerical challenge in modeling this problem is highlighted in this paper. It concerns the numerical diffusion that can occur because of the remeshing process required in this large deformation, moving boundary problem.},

abstract = {Resumen. El control de infraestructuras viales requiere evaluar la calidad de ejecuci{\'{o}}n (materiales, espesor de capas, compactaci{\'{o}}n{\ldots}) de las obras con el fin de asegurar la capacidad portante proyectada. El ensayo de placa de carga (ASTM D 1194) es uno de los m{\'{a}}s empleados para evaluar la capacidad portante. El ensayo consiste en la aplicaci{\'{o}}n de una serie de cargas al suelo mediante una placa circular, obteniendo as{\'{i}} el diagrama esfuerzo deformaci{\'{o}}n desde donde se determinan los m{\'{o}}dulos de reacci{\'{o}}n (E v1 y E v2). A pesar de su uso masivo, es un ensayo que requiere de recursos no siempre disponibles y tiempos prolongados para su ejecuci{\'{o}}n. Por otra parte, estos {\'{u}}ltimos 20 a{\~{n}}os hemos asistido al desarrollo creciente del ensayo de carga din{\'{a}}mica ligera (ASTM E2835). Este permite la obtenci{\'{o}}n del m{\'{o}}dulo din{\'{a}}mico (E vd) y de reacci{\'{o}}n (E v2) en menor tiempo y costo. Su utilizaci{\'{o}}n es com{\'{u}}n en Europa, as{\'{i}} como en Am{\'{e}}rica del norte. Aunque la versi{\'{o}}n din{\'{a}}mica del ensayo de placa responde a las dificultades operacionales del ensayo tradicional, en ambos casos la determinaci{\'{o}}n del grado de compactaci{\'{o}}n y del espesor de capas de la obra construida es imposible. El ensayo de penetraci{\'{o}}n PANDA{\textregistered}, ampliamente utilizado para el control de la compactaci{\'{o}}n en Francia y en muchos otros pa{\'{i}}ses, como en Chile (NCh 3261/2012), presenta as{\'{i}} un inter{\'{e}}s particular.

En el presente trabajo se propone una s{\'{i}}ntesis bibliogr{\'{a}}fica de los trabajos existentes, as{\'{i}} como un m{\'{e}}todo de an{\'{a}}lisis y correlaci{\'{o}}n entre los resultados de ensayos de placa y PANDA{\textregistered}, aplicable a diferentes tipolog{\'{i}}as de obras de ingenier{\'{i}}a y condiciones de aplicaci{\'{o}}n, basada en ensayos de laboratorio y terreno.},

abstract = {This paper explores the standard penetration test (SPT) hammer-anvil behavior and investigates the effect of secondary impact on SPT energy and sampler penetration. It is observed that the hammer-anvil behavior after the impact depends on the characteristics of the wave reflected from the sampler. The type-I secondary impact, which is dominant for N{\textless}25, is induced due to the rapid downward movement of the anvil and the recontact of the following hammer on the rebounding anvil. The maximum energy calculated by integrating force and velocity (EFV) is achieved immediately after the occurrence of the type-I secondary impact and an additional sampler penetration is triggered by the type-I secondary impact. The type-II secondary impact, which is dominant for N{\textgreater}50, is produced by the restrike of the pushed-up hammer on the resting anvil. The type-II secondary impact causes only recoverable anvil deformation and does not contribute to the maximum EFV energy. For N-values of 25-50, both or either types of secondary impacts happen. As N-value increases, the type-I secondary impact fade away progressively and the type-II secondary impact becomes more distinctive. {\textcopyright} 2010 ASCE.},

abstract = {The electric cone penetration test (CPT) has been in use for over 40 years and is growing in popularity in North America. This paper provides some recent updates on the interpretation of some key geotechnical parameters in an effort to develop a more unified approach. Extensive use is made of the normalized soil behaviour type (SBTn) chart based on normalized cone resistance (Qt) and normalized friction ratio (Fr). Updates are provided regarding the normalization process and its application to the identification of soil type. The seismic CPT has provided extensive data linking CPT net cone resistance to shear-wave velocity and soil modulus. New correlations are presented in the form of contours of key parameters on the SBTn chart. These new relationships enable a more unified interpretation of CPT results over a wide range of soils. Updates are also provided in terms of in situ state parameter, peak friction angle, and soil sensitivity. The correlations are evaluated using available laboratory and full-scale field test results. Many of the recommendations contained in this paper are focused on low to moderate risk projects where empirical interpretation tends to dominate. For projects where more advanced methods are more appropriate, the recommendations provided in this paper can be used as a screening to evaluate critical regions-zones where selective additional in situ testing and sampling maybe appropriate. {\textcopyright} 2009 NRC Canada.},

The position and shape of a critical state line (CSL) in the compression plane are important for constitutive models, interpretation of in situ tests and liquefaction analyses. It is not fully clear how grain crushing may affect the identification and uniqueness of the CSL in granular soils. Discrete-element simulations are used here to establish the relation between breakage-induced grading evolution and the CSL position in the compression plane. An efficient model of particle breakage is applied to perform a large number of tests, in which grading evolution is continuously tracked using a grading index. Using both previous and new experimental results, the discrete-element model is calibrated and validated to represent Fontainebleau sand, a quartz sand. The results obtained show that, when breakage is present, the inclusion of a grading index in the description of critical states is advantageous. This can be simply done using the critical state plane (CSP) concept. A CSP is obtained for Fontainebleau sand.},

Experimental research work has been carried out in the laboratory to study the grouted pile-to-rock connection (GPRC) and focused more precisely on the pile to grout connection when the pile is equipped with shear-keys that enhance the interface capacity. Monotonic and cyclic shear tests were performed using a specific direct shear test device (BCR3D), allowing application of sample confining conditions close to the in-situ conditions, namely constant normal stiffness conditions. Cyclic tests - either under one way or two-way shear loading application - were performed on several samples, under both constant volume and various constant stiffness boundary conditions. This study has shown that the strength of the interface is highly dependent on the combination of mean load, cyclic amplitudes and number of cycles applied to the interface. Cyclic failure was observed with less than 30 cycles for two-way and one-way cyclic loading.},

abstract = {Drystone retaining walls have played an essential part in the infrastructure of hilly and mountainous regions around the world, and have provided platforms for building and for agricultural terraces. Research carried out in England and in France has led to a good understanding of their behaviour, but it is difficult to determine the details of the construction of individual walls without dismantling them, and so it can be hard to tell whether or not apparent defects and deformations are a threat to stability. Replacing every apparently defective or deformed wall would be a waste of resources, yet dismantling a wall would obviously be completely disruptive to its function. Invasive investigation, such as drilling, could easily cause damage to the wall structure and destabilise the wall. There is therefore a pressing need for non-disruptive methods of investigation that can reveal critical aspects of a wall's construction. Thermal imaging carried out in the right conditions can reveal important information about aspects of a wall's construction that are critical to its stability. This paper presents case studies that have contributed to the development of this technique, and demonstrate its potential.},

abstract = {The characterization of sedimentary soil, and specifically 'intermediate' soils such as silty sands, non-plastic silts, clayey silts, and fine grained tailings are often challenging due to difficulties in sampling and testing and in interpretation of in-situ data. Cone penetrometer testing where the penetration rate is varied to control drainage conditions has been explored recently. The penetration rates required for undrained and drained conditions are proportional to the coefficient of consolidation, and a two order of magnitude change in penetration rate is generally required to move from one limiting condition to another. This paper utilizes experimental, analytical, and numerical research to examine practical implementation issues as well as theoretical details for proper analysis of variable penetration rate test data. Specifically, normalized relationships are presented to relate cone tip and pore pressure measurements to penetration rate. It is shown that partial consolidation during cone penetration at the standard rate of 2 cm/s exists if the t 50 from pore pressure dissipation test is less than 100 seconds. The errors induced by partial consolidation during penetration on interpretation of both soil behavior type charts and pore pressure dissipation data are then examined; a new solution for estimation of the coefficient of consolidation from pore pressure dissipation is presented. A new two-stage automated hydraulic control system capable of penetration rates from 20 cm/s down to 0.002 cm/s is then presented. A practical framework and chart for selection of penetration rates required to obtain drained or undrained measurements for a given soil is discussed. Finally, numerical cavity expansion results using a modified MIT-S1 constitutive model within FLAC indicate that the initial state, in-situ stress, limiting compression curve reference stress, and stress-dilatancy characteristics are the primary factors affecting the ratio of drained to undrained cone tip resistance.},

A macro-element approach is used to represent a rod driven with an impact like those applied to perform SPT. The rod is driven into a chamber filled with a scaled discrete analogue of a quartz sand. The contact properties of the discrete analogue are calibrated simulating two low-pressure triaxial tests. The rod is driven changing input energy and controlling initial density and confinement stress. Energy-based blowcount normalization is shown to be effective. Results obtained are in good quantitative agreement with well-accepted experimentally-based relations between blowcount, density and overburden. It is also shown that the tip resistance measured under impact dynamic penetration conditions is close to that under constant velocity conditions, hence supporting recent proposals to relate CPT and SPT results.},

abstract = {A 3D numerical model for mechanised excavations is presented, which is capable of simulating the overall process of excavation and construction of a tunnel when a TBM EPB (Tunnel Boring Machine-Earth Pressure Balance) is used. The main construction aspects of a mechanised excavation are modelled. Their influence on calculated ground displacements are investigated by means of a series of parametric analyses. With the aim of testing the performance of the proposed 3D numerical model, a series of 25 Class C predictions has been carried out. Case Histories related to the construction of the 1995-2003 Madrid Metro Extension Project were considered for this purpose. As a general rule, the results obtained with the Modified Cam-Clay model closely fit in situ measurements. When the Linear-Elastic or the Mohr-Coulomb models are used, it is not as easy to summarise the results obtained, as higher fluctuations are observed around in situ measured data. A good agreement is also shown when the distribution of horizontal displacements along depth is considered. For some sections, the mechanised excavation model is not capable of reproducing the high values of the surface settlements measured in situ. A closer look at the results shows that mixed face conditions are found for these cases, with the TBM excavating through layered soil formations having sharply different mechanical behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Authors. Experimental studies have indicated that the small strain shear modulus, G max , of unsaturated silt and clay has a greater amount during imbibition than during drainage, when presented as a function of matric suction. However, due to material properties and inter-particle forces, different behavior is expected in the case of sand. Although considerable research has been devoted in recent years to characterize the behaviour of G max of sand during drainage, rather less attention has been paid to the effect of hydraulic hysteresis on G max and its variations during imbibition. In the study presented herein, an effort has been made to compare the G max behavior of specimens of silt and sand during hydraulic hysteresis. In this regard, a series of bender element tests were carried out in a modified triaxial test device with suction-saturation control to evaluate the impact of hydraulic hysteresis on G max for specimens of silt and sand. Trends between the G max and matric suction for unsaturated sand were found to be different from those for silty specimens. The variations in G max showed an up and down trend in both drainage and imbibition paths for sandy specimens, where plotted as a function of matric suction. Results also indicated smaller magnitudes of G max upon imbibition than those during drainage; a behavior which is believed to be attributed to variations in suction stress with matric suction. In silty specimens, a stiffer response was measured during imbibition which was hypothesized to be due to drainage-induced hardening experienced by the specimens that was not fully recovered during imbibition.},

Quasi-static compressive properties of the sand were obtained with a MTS810 materials test system. In both dynamic and quasi-static experiments, the 1.50 × 103 kg/m3 dry sand, confined with a polycarbonate tube, had the same dimensions, making the strain rate the only variable. The strain rate effects on the compressive response of the sand were determined. The sand was also prepared to specimens with a higher initial density of 1.62 × 103 kg/m3 for dynamic experiments to investigate the initial density (gas porosity) effects. At a given dynamic strain rate, besides using the polycarbonate confining tube, polyolefin heat shrinking tubes and 4340 steel tubes were used to confine the sand specimens to study the lateral confinement effects. The results show that the compressive response of the dry sand is not sensitive to strain rate under the loading conditions in this study, but significantly dependent on the initial density and lateral confinement level. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Field tests are widely used for soil characterization in geotechnical applications in spite of implementation difficulties. The light penetrometer is a well-known testing tool for fine soils, but the physical interpretation of the output data in the case of coarse granular materials is far less evident. Indeed, the data are considerably more sensitive in this case to various parameters such as fabric structure, particle shapes or the applied impact energy. In order to achieve a better understanding of the penetration process into a coarse granular material, a numerical study was performed by means of contact dynamics simulations. The penetration of a moving tip in a sample composed of irregular grain shapes was studied and the influence of the driving velocity and input energy on the penetration strength was analyzed. The results show that the latter grows with both the penetration rate and energy, despite the strong fluctuations occur due to a jamming-unjamming process in which the contact network connectivity evolves intermittently in correlation with the penetration strength. This analysis suggests that the time-averaged data provided by a penetrometer is reliable information from which the bulk strength properties of coarse granular materials can be evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The first is a workaround to incorporate the effects of pile installation into a small-strain finite element method, by application of volume strains or prescribed displacements on the pile soil interface. The second approach is a simulation of the installation in an Eularian numerical scheme. The results of both methods are compared with experimental results of a pile installation and pile test of a jacked displacement pile in sand.},

abstract = {To analyze seismic wave propagation in geological structures, it is possible to consider various numerical approaches: the finite difference method, the spectral element method, the boundary element method, the finite element method, the finite volume method, and so on. All these methods have various advantages and drawbacks to analyze the propagation of seismic waves. In surficial soil layers, seismic waves may be strongly amplified because of the velocity contrast between these layers and, possibly, to topographic effects around crests and hills. The influence of the geometry of alluvial basins on the amplification process is also know to be large. Nevertheless, strong heterogeneities and complex geometries are not easy to take into account with all numerical methods. Two-dimensional/three dimensional (2D/3D) models are needed in many situations, and the efficiency/accuracy of the numerical methods in such cases is in question. Furthermore, the radiation conditions at infinity are not easy to handle with finite differences or finite/spectral elements, whereas it is explicitly accounted for in the boundary element method. Various absorbing layer methods (e.g., F-PML, M-PML, CALM) were recently proposed to attenuate the spurious wave reflections, especially in some difficult cases, such as shallow numerical models or grazing incidences. Finally, strong earthquakes may involve nonlinear effects in surficial soil layers. To model strong ground motion, it is thus necessary to consider the nonlinear dynamic behavior of soils and simultaneously investigate seismic wave propagation in complex 2D/3D geological structures. Recent advances in numerical formulations and constitutive models in such complex situations are presented and discussed in this paper. A crucial issue is the availability of the field/laboratory data to feed and validate such models. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Thomas Telford Services Ltd, All right resereved.Bender elements are used to measure the low-strain shear-wave velocity of soils in many geotechnical laboratories worldwide. Despite their popularity, the method remains without a standard, mainly owing to the difficulties in controlling the actual behaviour of the bender element inside the specimen. Previous experimental and analytical studies on the behaviour of bender elements have found evidence that the actual transmitter movement is not equal in shape or frequency content of the electrical signal used as the input excitation. Furthermore, the size and geometry of the specimen influence the response of these piezoelectric transducers. In this study, miniature accelerometers are used to measure the particle vibration inside specimens during bender elements tests, which were performed in a resonant column device. The comparison between shear wave velocities obtained by resonant column and miniature accelerometers tests allow a better interpretation of bender element testing. The sine pulse bender element test results showed good agreement with the resonant column measurements. The results show the importance of the resonant frequencies of the bender element and their influence on frequency domain analysis of bender element testing.},

abstract = {Piles are normally subjected to axial loads. However, in many cases lateral loads have also to be transferred in addition to axial loads. Till now, it is not clear how important the interaction effects are, dependent on various factors such as pile stiffness, soil type and loading conditions. In this paper, results of numerical simulation of behavior of short and nearly rigid piles as well as long, flexible piles embedded in sandy soil under inclined loads are presented. For the sandy soil an elasto-plastic constitutive material law has been used. The results are shown in terms of load-deformation curves for the lateral and the axial loading portions. It is shown that for inclined compression loading the behavior under lateral load is nearly independent of a vertical load, whereas the behavior under vertical load is strongly influenced in particular for short piles. For inclined tension loading of short piles also the horizontal load deformation curve is dependent on the vertical load portion, because it significantly affects the ultimate vertical load. Interaction diagrams are presented, which characterize the pile behavior under inclined loads.},

Development of material models to describe the thermodynamic shock states of distended mixtures is motivated by the need to understand how these materials respond over large compression ranges starting from low-pressure mechanical crush, extending into extreme thermodynamic states, and subsequent release to low-pressure. A material modeling approach is presented, which is comprised of a thermodynamically consistent equation-of-state (EOS) within a mixture-modeling framework. This modeling approach enables the investigator to describe the dynamic response of distended mixtures over a large compression range. The EOS model is applied to shock Hugoniot data on tungsten carbide, tantalum pentoxide, and calcite-water mixtures.},

The von Mises yield criterion and its associated flow rule are assumed to model the plastic behaviour of elastoplastic undrained clays. An arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian scheme and an enhanced hourglass algorithm are adopted to preserve the quality of mesh throughout the numerical simulation. Initially, the behaviour of the penetration resistance is examined in a soil with only two layers. The bottom layer is the weaker of the two and the behaviour of the penetration resistance when the cone approaches the lower layer is studied. The investigation is then extended to study the cone penetration test in a multi-layered clay by sandwiching a weaker clay layer between two stronger clay layers. The thickness of the weaker clay layer is varied and the behaviour of the penetration resistance is studied in relation to the thickness and relative strength of the soil layers. The results are discussed with respect to the soil mechanisms that are present when the cone moves past the relevant layer boundaries so that the position of these boundaries can be determined more accurately.},

The results of these tests do not agree when extrapolated to similar strain levels. The main objectives of this paper are to evaluate the effect of excitation frequency on the dynamic properties of soils, and to provide a methodology to reconcile shear modulus values obtained from RC and CT tests. The effect of frequency on the dynamic properties is evaluated using the new non-resonance (NR) method in the RC device and CT tests. Sand specimens with varying percentages of bentonitewater mixture and a clay specimen are tested. The results obtained from RC tests utilizing the NR method indicate significant change in shear modulus with frequency. The extrapolation of shear modulus from the conventional RC results to shear strains used in CT is significantly overestimated. The extrapolations improved when the results were corrected for frequency effect inferred from the NR method. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Field experiments have demonstrated that piles driven into sand can respond to axial cyclic loading in Stable, Unstable or Meta-Stable ways, depending on the combinations of mean and cyclic loads and the number of cycles. An understanding of the three styles of responses is provided by experiments involving a highly instrumented model displacement pile and an array of soil stress sensors installed in fine sand in a pressurised calibration chamber. The different patterns of effective stress developing on and around the shaft are reported, along with the results of static load tests that track the effects on shaft capacity. The interpretation links these observations to the sand's stress-strain behaviour. The interface-shear characteristics, the kinematic yielding, the local densification, the growth of a fractured interface-shear zone and the restrained dilatancy at the pile-soil interface are all found to be important. The model tests are shown to be compatible with the full-scale behaviour and to provide key information for improving the modelling and the design rules. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Japanese Geotechnical Society.},

abstract = {The traditional dynamic load test, based on the one-dimensional wave propagation theory consists in applying a sequence of constant energy blows and making measurements using deformation and acceleration sensors installed on top of the pile, as a function of time. The traditional method has evolved with the development of a numerical model that simulates the Static Load Test (SLT) of a pile dynamically tested. Another evolution was the introduction of the Dynamic Increasing Energy Test (DIET) created and proposed by Aoki (1997). The present study is an initiative to deepen the increasing energy method focusing on the definition of the maximum lateral resistance envelope, allowing the recovery of the mobilized resistance along the shaft, lost in blows prior to the maximum applied energy, especially in layers close to the top of the pile. This procedure is called the Maximum Envelope of Lateral Resistance. Two case studies are presented, in which static and dynamic tests were performed on the same pile. The application of the Maximum Envelope of Lateral Resistance, also referred to as Maximum Envelope Method, led to a definition of higher load capacities through the CAPWAP analysis, with simulated load-displacement curves with good correlations in comparison with the Static Load Tests (SLT). When performed after several rest periods, the Maximum Envelope Method allows an assessment of the “set up” development over time.},

abstract = {The response of unsaturated soil slopes subjected to raised groundwater levels is generally governed by undrained shear strength. A series of unconsolidated undrained triaxial tests was conducted on reconstructed specimens of Xiashu loess with different water content. This can avoid the complexity involved with the measurement of matric suction. The Duncan-Chang hyperbolic model was modified to approximate the measured stress-strain responses. A correlation between water content and shear-strength parameters was established. The proposed model was then implemented in a finite-difference analysis program, against which two conventional calculations using the standard Mohr-Coulomb model with constant and varying soil properties with depth were compared. The analyses of an unsaturated soil slope subjected to raised groundwater levels demonstrate that soil properties should vary with water content; otherwise, an unsafe evaluation of slope stability will be obtained because the displacements of the slope may be underestimated if the dependency of water content is neglected.},

abstract = {Pressure-shear experiments were performed on granular tungsten carbide and sand using a newly- refurbished slotted barrel gun. The sample is a thin layer of the granular material sandwiched between driver and anvil plates that remain elastic. Because of the obliquity, impact generates both a longitudinal wave, which compresses the sample, and a shear wave that probes the strength of the sample. Laser velocity interferometry is employed to measure the velocity history of the free surface of the anvil. Since the driver and anvil remain elastic, analysis of the results is, in principal, straightforward. Experiments were performed at pressures up to nearly 2 GPa using titanium plates and at higher pres- sure using zirconium plates. Those done with the titanium plates produced values of shear stress of 0.1-0.2 GPa, with the value increasing with pressure. On the other hand, those experiments conducted with zir- conia anvils display results that may be related to slipping at an interface and shear stresses mostly at 0.1 GPa or less. Recovered samples display much greater particle fracture than is observed in planar loading, suggesting that shearing is a very effective mechanism for comminution of the grains.},

abstract = {Results from dynamic penetration tests are traditionally interpreted on the basis of empirical correlations, this being a frequent criticism to these tests. An alternative rational method of interpretation is proposed in this paper from which the energy delivered to the composition of rods is used to calculate a dynamic force that represents the reaction of the soil to the penetration of the sampler (F d ). Interpretation of soil properties both in sand and clay is based on this calculated dynamic force from which the internal friction angle and the undrained shear strength can be estimated. This is achieved from a simple combination of limit equilibrium analysis and cavity expansion theory. Case studies gathered from the Brazilian experience are reported in this paper to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} ASCE 2009.},

In case of working with metallic P-wave source, the effect of the air-filled zone and disturbance of the air-wave are received by geophones located near the source (short offset). It is possible to reduce the effect of the disturbance of air-wave and to obtain correct P- and S-wave velocities by using source equipment consisting plastic hammer and wooden cone for very short offsets. In this study, a 12-channel seismograph with signal stacking ability was used together with high frequency (100 Hz) geophones on the top-soil. The geophone intervals were set to 20 cm at the all locations. Two dimensional models were constructed by applying two dimensional inversions to the first arrival time of direct and refracted waves. It was seen that compressional wave velocity (Vp) values of very-near-surface soils are lower than the velocity of the Pwave in air (330 m/s). Additionally, it should be noted that the ratio between P and S wave velocity is about 1.5 in the dry unconsolidated top-soils. {\textcopyright} 2010 Academic Journals.},

abstract = {New results of the experimental-theoretical and numerical analysis of the dynamic behavior of dry and water-saturated sand, impacted and penetrated by cylindrical strikers at the velocities from 50 to 450 m/s, are presented. Forces resisting penetration dependences into soil are determined using the inverse experiment technique, in which a container with sand impacts the end of a measuring bar with flat, hemispheric and conic heads. Based on the experimental-computational analysis of maximal and quasi-stationary values of the force resisting penetration of a flat-ended striker, parameters of dynamic compressibility and resistance to shear of compacted water-saturated sand are found. Using the obtained data the parameters of the Grigoryan's model were determined (identified), with the help of which numerical calculations of the resistance to penetration of impactors into the soil in an axisymmetric formulation of the mechanics of continuous media were carried out. It is shown that the identified mathematical model and the results of the computational experiment are in good agreement with the experimental data. It is found that, when compacted sand is practically fully water-saturated, its shearing properties degrade but remain substantial in the practically important range of impact interaction velocities.},

abstract = {Significant advances have been made in recent years in research, development, interpretation, and application of cone penetration testing. The addition ofpore pressure measurements during cone penetration testing has added a new dimension to the interpretation of geotechnical parameters. The cone penetration test induces complex changes in stresses and strains around the cone tip. No one has yet developed a comprehensive theoretical solution to this problem. Hence, the cone penetration test provides indices which can be correlated to soil behaviour. Therefore, the interpretation of cone penetration data is made with empirical correlations to obtain required geotechnical parameters. This paper discusses the significant recent developments in cone penetration testing and presents a summarized work guide for practicing engineers for interpretation for soil classification, and parameters for drained conditions during the test such as relative density, drained shear strength, and deformation characteristics of sand. Factors that influence the interpretation are discussed and guidelines provided. The companion paper, Part 11: Clay, considers undrained conditions during the test and summarizes recent developments to interpret parameters for clay soils, such as undrained shear strength, deformation characteristics ofclay, stress history, consolidation characteristics, permeability, and pore pressure. The advantages and use ofthe piezometer cone are discussed as a separate topic in Part 11: Clay. The authors' personal experiences and current recommendations are included.},

abstract = {Ladle furnace basic slag (LFS) is a by-product of the steelmaking industry that can be used in civil works, especially for soil stabilization. This sustainable application is based on the reactivity of certain compounds at ambient temperatures such as calcium aluminates, free calcium oxide and free magnesium oxide. These compounds show hydraulic reactivity and subsequent interaction between each other and with the clayey fraction, resulting in improvements to the geotechnical properties of the soil such as its bearing capacity and free swelling. This study looks at the long-term aging reactions of LFS and the properties of various soil-LFS mixes, to gain further knowledge of the behaviour of this by-product as a construction and building material and the inherent risk of volumetric instability associated with its use. The final conclusion is that LFS can be applied in soil stabilization as efficiently as conventional soil stabilizers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the study, a finite difference computer program FLAC was adopted for numerical analysis. The results of numerical analysis provided the stresses and yielding pattern of soil underlying the TCP as well as the displacement of the TCP. Based on the results of analysis together with available field and laboratory TCP data, statistical regression analyses were performed to obtain mathematical relations between N TCP and c u with due consideration of depth effect. Results of the study provided the N TCP vs. c u relations which indicate that the current relations used by TxDOT appear to be depth dependent and can be effectively used mainly for a depth less than 25-ft.},

abstract = {Finite element cavity expansion analysis investigating the effect of penetration rate on piezocone tests in clay is presented. A coupled analysis was performed, in which the rate of cavity expansion was linked to the penetration rate of the cone and the cone angle, using the assumption that the deformation was wholly radial, and took place only between the cone tip and the cone shoulder. The soil was modelled using modified cam clay with two sets of parameters and varying values of overconsolidation ratio (OCR). The influence of penetration rate on the stress and pore pressure distributions was examined. For slower penetration rates, the excess pore pressure at the cone shoulder is lower since consolidation is permitted coincident with penetration. The radial profiles of post-penetration voids ratio demonstrate that partially drained penetration is permitted by volume change in the near field, in addition to radial movement in the far field. The radial distribution of excess pore pressure after slow penetration differs from the undrained case, with a relatively low radial gradient existing at the cone face. As a result, the dissipation curves after slow penetration lag behind those following fast penetration. The cone velocity is made dimensionless by normalizing with the coefficient of consolidation and the cone diameter. 'Backbone' curves of normalized velocity against normalized tip resistance and excess pore pressure capturing the transition from undrained to drained penetration are derived. The normalized pore pressure backbone curve is unique, whilst the normalized tip resistance shows a small dependency on OCR. These backbone penetration curves are compared with centrifuge model piezocone tests conducted at varying rates, and subsequent dissipation tests. The numerical and experimental results suggest that the value of consolidation coefficient operative during the dissipation phase is 2-4 times higher than the virgin compression value due to changes in the operative soil stiffness, as demonstrated from the stress paths of individual soil elements. The use of multirate penetration tests to deduce values of consolidation coefficient is discussed, in light of these differences. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Three soil powders with different maximum aggregate sizes (Dmax = 5, 1 and 0.4 mm) were prepared prior to the treatment with 2{\%} of lime. X-ray diffraction (XRD), environmental scanning electron microscope (Env.

Crystallized C-S-H on tobermorite form was identified in the lime-treated soil prepared with large aggregates after one year curing, and an evident increase in nanopores {\textless} 0.1 $\mu$m C-S-H was also observed due to C-S-H creation. By contrast, in the case of smaller aggregates, no obvious C-S-H peaks were observed by XRD technique after the same curing time, even though some evidence of such phases are provided by Env. SEM coupled to EDX analysis. But a large amount of undetectable nanopores {\textless} 6 nm (considering the MIP technical limitation) was supposed to be formed and could be attributed to the creation of nanocrystallized C-S-H or poorly-crystallized C-S-H (that may fill the pores larger than 2 $\mu$m). Such type of C-S-H phases occurred when lime was coated in thin layer on the large surface associated to lime-treated soil prepared with small aggregates.},

The results show that the simulations are able to reproduce qualitatively the typical trend of the penetration resistance profile in cohesive solid characterized by a steady-state at large penetration depths. The contact model is also capable of capturing the dependence of the penetration resistance on the consolidation stress history. Furthermore, the simulations reproduce the relationship between the unconfined strength and the penetration resistance that has been reported in real cohesive materials. Finally, we investigated the scaling laws of the contact model parameters to produce the same load–deformation behavior invariant of the particle size used in the simulations. The results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model to simulate complex processes involving cohesive solid at large engineering scale scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical model for the simulation of the piezocone penetration test that is used to carry out a parametric study of the piezocone penetration test in cohesive soils. The piezocone penetration is numerically simulated using an axisymmetric elasto-plastic large deformation finite-element analysis code. The numerical simulation is accomplished in two stages. First, the piezocone is expanded radially from an initial small radius (0.1ro) to the piezocone radius, ro, at the specified depth. Second, the continuous penetration of the piezocone is simulated by applying incremental vertical displacements of the nodes representing the piezocone boundary. The constraint approach is used to model the soil-piezocone interface friction. The Mohr-Coulomb frictional criterion is used to define the sliding potential of the nodes. The main objective of this paper is to present the numerical model and to investigate the effect of the lateral and vertical stresses and the overconsolidation ratio on the cone tip resistance and the developed excess pore pressure around the piezocone. The variation of the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity coefficients on the developed spatial excess pore pressure and its dissipation are also investigated. The results of the numerical study are also compared with the miniature piezocone penetration tests in cohesive soil specimens conducted at the Louisiana State University Calibration Chamber. Results of this study are in good agreement with the measured values. {\textcopyright} 2003 ASCE.},

abstract = {A cavity expansion-based theory for calculation of cone penetration resistance qc in sand is presented. The theory includes a completely new analysis to obtain cone resistance from cavity limit pressure. In order to more clearly link the proposed theory with the classical cavity expansion theories, which were based on linear elastic, perfectly plastic soil response, linear equivalent values of elasticity modulus, Poisson's ratio and friction and dilatancy angles are given in charts as a function of relative density, stress state, and critical-state friction angle. These linear-equivalent values may be used in the classical theories to obtain very good estimates of cavity pressure. A much simpler way to estimate qc -- based on direct reading from charts in terms of relative density, stress state and critical state friction angle – is also proposed. Finally, a single equation obtained by regression of qc on relative density and stress state for a range of values of critical state friction angle is also proposed. Examples illustrate the different ways of calculating cone resistance and interpreting cone penetration test results. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {The anisotropy of soil behaviour may be critical to anticipate the response of a soil mass interacting with a civil engineering structure. An experimental program has been implemented to observe and highlight anisotropy and to identify the influence of this phenomenon. For this purpose, we studied two main types of soil anisotropy: induced anisotropy, which corresponds to 'homogeneous' soil with anisotropic behaviour due to historical loads, and inherent anisotropy, corresponding to soils with structural anisotropy. An experimental program has been followed based on a laboratory study of soil samples reconstituted not to accurately simulate a given natural soil, but to have a marked anisotropy that can be observed unequivocally. Creation of reference behaviour for anisotropic soil was the main objective. The results obtained from these reconstituted samples were compared with those of Cubzac-les-Ponts soft clays, where experimental embankments have been monitored for 30 years. The research consists in a laboratory study of the behaviour of two types of anisotropy (inherent and induced) of soils under various stress paths to characterize the variation of the elastic parameters of soils at small strains, the evolution of elastic moduli from small to high strains, the apparition of plastic deformations, and the experimental flow rules. Experimental results have been interpreted with the models usually adopted for real projects, assuming that the behaviour is isotropic; in this respect, the analysis makes it possible to investigate the errors induced by the choice of this simplifying assumption. The results show the influence of anisotropy on the various aspects of soil behavior; they also show how anisotropy can be characterized by means of tests performed with standard equipment, provided that results are interpreted with precaution.

abstract = {Eighty subscale penetration tests were performed to investigate penetration phenomenology in granular media, with impact velocities in the range of 70-300 m/s. The parameter space consisted of (1) four natural and synthetic granular materials, including Ottawa sand, crushed fused quartz, aragonite, and crushed coral, (2) loose and dense packings, (3) dry and wet targets, and (4) four different projectiles, including spheres and long rods with conical, hemispherical and blunt nose shapes. Two techniques were employed to obtain penetration time histories, including photonic Doppler velocimetry for high velocity impact tests, and high speed imaging for low velocity impact tests. Penetration time histories were differentiated to obtain velocity and acceleration time histories. Analysis of the time histories revealed that the role of nose shape, packing density, and saturation is material dependent. Silica sands and calcareous sands showed contrasting behavior across the parameter space considered. These observations point to the significance of particle crushing in rapid penetration into granular media.},

The induced excess pore pressure is important to evaluate the stress state variations in clay and the subsequent pile bearing capacity. The main objective of this paper is to present a finite element numerical model to simulate a mini-cone installation (representing pile) and subsequent pore water pressure dissipation with time. The effect of OCR on soil stress state is also investigated. The numerical model is validated using the results of a physical model in which a mini-cone is penetrated into a consolidation chamber containing saturated clay. The results show that higher OCR develops less excess pore water pressure during installation. It is shown, however, that radial and vertical effective stresses as well as the coefficient of lateral earth pressure increase with increasing OCR during the excess pore water pressure dissipation process.},

In addition, the movement of sand particles was extracted using PIV(Particle Image Velocimetry) method. The CT images of the experimental results showed that the condition of wedge formation below the open-ended pile was clearly different from that below the close-ended pile. Although the penetration resistance of the open-ended pile and close-ended pile was similar, the movement of soil inside the open-ended pile was not stopped but restricted, as shown by intermittent increases and decreases in penetration resistance during pile driving. Finally, knowledge of the plugging phenomenon was obtained by analyzing the distribution of the alteration of soil volume and shear strain in X-ray CT images.},

The technical note also describes details about how to determine the Mohr-Coulomb strength parameters c and ϕ for well-compacted fills (with and without cohesion), of which the failure envelopes are typically curved. The motivation for preparing this technical note came from a study on analysis of field-scale soil–geosynthetic composites in which the soil model and model parameters deduced from triaxial tests were able to predict with very good accuracy “all” measured results of five field-scale soil–geosynthetic composites under increasing applied vertical loads up to 1000 kPa (approximately five times the load level commonly used in design of reinforced soil bridge abutments). The model parameters were determined by a well-defined protocol. The protocol should be of value to researchers and engineers who use the soil model for sophisticated finite element analysis and design of earth structures.},

A finite difference based numerical software FLAC3D has been used for simulating the field conditions by simulating similar soil-pile models for each case. The net pile displacement and ultimate pile capacity determined from the field tests and estimated by using numerical analyses are compared. It is seen that the ultimate capacity of the pile computed using FLAC3D differs from the field test results by around 9{\%}, thereby indicating the efficiency of FLAC3D as reliable numerical software for analyzing pile foundations subjected to impact loading. Moreover, various parameters like top layers of cohesive soil varying from soft to stiff consistency, pile length, pile diameter, pile impedance and critical height of fall of the hammer have been found to influence both pile displacement and net pile capacity substantially. It may, therefore, be suggested to include the test in relevant IS code of practice.},

abstract = {Sand roughness is now accessible to measurement. Incorporating this parameter into sand models using the discrete element method (DEM) is known to improve bulk small strain response. In this work we explore the effect on problems where particle crushing takes place. A well-established DEM particle crushing model and a rough Hertzian contact model are here combined to incorporate both effects in a single contact model. Including contact roughness results in stronger particles whilst all other material parameters being equal. The model is then used to simulate high pressure oedometric compression tests on a strong silica sand. It is shown that including realistic values of surface roughness enables to correctly capture both load-unload behaviour and particle size distribution evolution while using realistic values of elastic bulk properties for the sand grains. Roughness is then a model refinement that may result in simpler, more objective DEM calibrations.},

In the first three groups of experiments, the water contents of samples were 4.8{\%}, 7.5{\%}, and 10{\%}, and the initial density of all the samples was 1.8 g/cm 3 . In the last group, the initial density was 1.9 g/cm 3 and the water content was 10{\%}. The dry density of the last group was nearly the same as the first group. The manufacturing process of the samples, and the experimental settings were the same in all the experiments. The experimental results show that, when the initial density was the same and the water content was different in the sample, the Hugoniot data were nearly consistent, and when the dry density was same, the dynamic behavior of the soil was obviously influenced by the water content boundary conditions.},

abstract = {Changes in substructure conditions, such as ballast fouling and subgrade settlement may cause the railway quality deterioration, including the differential geometry of the rails. The objective of this study is to develop and apply a hybrid cone penetrometer (HCP) to characterize the railway substructure. The HCP consists of an outer rod and an inner mini cone, which can dynamically and statically penetrate the ballast and the subgrade, respectively. An accelerometer and four strain gauges are installed at the head of the outer rod and four strain gauges are attached at the tip of the inner mini cone. In the ballast, the outer rod provides a dynamic cone penetration index (DCPI) and the collected DCPI (CDCPI) with the energy transferred into the rod head. Then, the inner mini cone is pushed to estimate the strength of the subgrade from the cone tip resistance. Laboratory application tests are performed on the specimen, which is prepared with gravel and sandy soil. In addition, the HCP is applied in the field and compared with the standard dynamic cone penetration test. The results from the laboratory and the field tests show that the cone tip resistance is inversely proportional to the CDCPI. Furthermore, in the subgrade, the HCP produces a high-resolution profile of the cone tip resistance and a profile of the CDCPI in the ballast. This study suggests that the dynamic and static penetration tests using the HCP may be useful for characterizing the railway substructure.},

abstract = {The paper considers two techniques to model the Cone Penetration Test (CPT) end resistance, qc in a dense sand deposit using commercial finite element programmes. In the first approach, Plaxis was used to perform spherical cavity expansion analyses at multiple depths. Two soil models, namely; the Mohr-Coulomb (MC) and Hardening Soil (HS) models were utilized. When calibrated using simple laboratory element tests, the HS model was found to provide good estimates of qc. However, at shallow depths, where the over-consolidation ratio of the sand was highest, the relatively large horizontal stresses developed prevented the full development of the failure zone resulting in under-estimation of the qc value. The second approach involved direct simulation of cone penetration using a large-strain analysis implemented in Abaqus/Explicit. The Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) technique was used to prevent excessive mesh deformation. Although the Druker-Prager soil model used was not as sophisticated as the HS model, excellent agreement was achieved between the predicted and measured qc profiles. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The problem of cone penetration, particularly deep penetration, remains one of the most challenging in geotechnical engineering. It involves large displacements, rotations and deformation of soil elements in the path of the cone as well as complex response of the soil, including crushing and the development of large mean stresses, to the displacements imposed by the penetration process. As a result, rigorous theoretical solutions are not available for this problem, and experimental simulations of penetration provide insights that would not otherwise be available. This paper presents the results of a series of cone penetration tests performed in a half-circular chamber in sand samples prepared with three silica sands with different crushability. Cone resistance was measured, and digital images of the cone penetrating into the sand samples were acquired simultaneously during the entire penetration process. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was then used to process these images to obtain the soil displacement field resulting from cone penetration. The results of DIC analyses and measured cone resistance suggest that the soil displacement around an advancing cone depends on the density and crushability of the sand, as well as the depth of penetration. Tests on silica sands with different degrees of crushability show that, for shallow penetration, the displacement vectors near the cone tip are essentially vertical for crushable sand, transitioning to subvertical for less crushable sands. However, for deep penetration, the displacement vectors near the cone tip are mostly vertical below the cone tip. Crushing was observed immediately below and around the cone tip for all sands tested. After passage of the cone, the crushed particles form a thin, crushed particle band of thickness equal to about 2{\textperiodcentered}5D50 along the shaft, with a smaller percentage of crushed particles observed within an outer band with thickness equal to 4D50.},

However, the use of ultrasonic testing to determine pulse velocities and small-strain elastic constants of soils is less common, as soils have higher damping characteristics which result in measurement difficulty. The signal transmitted through soil is weak and very noisy. As a result, the signal must be properly processed to provide a reliable estimate of the wave travel time. In this paper, an ultrasonic test system consisting of compression and shear wave transducers, a pulser, and a data-acquisition system is evaluated for measurement of both compression and shear wave velocities. Among the specimens tested were fully saturated and unsaturated soil specimens. The effects of acoustic coupling and signal processing on the transmitted pulse were investigated. The strain levels associated with the determination of the wave velocities were also measured. Furthermore, a method for determining attenuation characteristics for soil specimens from the frequency spectra is suggested. {\textcopyright} 2004 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {Insufficient regeneration of central nervous system (CNS) axons contributes to persisting neurological dysfunction after spinal cord injury (SCI). Peripheral nerve grafts (PNGs) support regeneration by thousands of injured intraspinal axons and help them bypass some of the extracellular barriers that form after SCI. However this number represents but a small portion of the total number of axons that are injured. Here we tested if rhythmic sensory stimulation during cycling exercise would boost the intrinsic regenerative state of neurons to enhance axon regeneration into PNGs after a lower thoracic (T12) spinal transection of adult rats. Using True Blue retrograde tracing, we show that 4. weeks of cycling improves regeneration into a PNG from lumbar interneurons but not by primary sensory neurons. The majority of neurons that regenerate their axon are within 5. mm of the lesion and their number increased 70{\%} with exercise. Importantly propriospinal neurons in more distant regions (5-20. mm from the lesion) that routinely exhibit very limited regeneration responded to exercise by increasing the number of regenerating neurons by 900{\%}. There was no exercise-associated increase in regeneration from sensory neurons. Analyses using fluorescent in situ hybridization showed that this increase in regenerative response is associated with changes in levels of mRNAs encoding the regeneration associated genes (RAGs) GAP43, ??-actin and Neuritin. While propriospinal neurons showed increased mRNA levels in response to SCI alone and then to grafting and exercise, sensory neurons did not respond to SCI, but there was a response to the presence of a PNG. Thus, exercise is a non-invasive approach to modulate gene expression in injured neurons leading to an increase in regeneration. This sets the stage for future studies to test whether exercise will promote axon outgrowth beyond the PNG and reconnection with spinal cord neurons, thereby demonstrating a potential clinical application of this combined therapeutic intervention.},

An effort is made to relate these damping properties to common physical properties of the soils tested. A series of dynamic (impact) and static tests were performed on a variety of sand and clay soils. The sands varied in grain size and grain shape, and the clays varied in plasticity and moisture content. Velocity of sample deformation, peak dynamic loads, and peak static loads were measured so that damping constants for the soils could be evaluated. A mathematical model in current use which describes soil action at the point of a pile is examined. The model is used in wave equation studies of piling behavior. A modification of this model is made in order to achieve a constant damping value over the full range of loading velocities. Damping constants are evaluated for all soils tested. The damping constant is related to void ratio and effective angle of internal shearing resistance in sands, and moisture content and liquidity index in clays.},

abstract = {This work presents a simplified approach for the nonlinear analysis of the load–displacement response of a single pile and pile groups embedded in multilayered soils. A hyperbolic model is used to capture the relationship between the skin friction and the pile–soil relative displacement developing along the pile–soil interface. The shaft displacement is assumed to be composed of the pile–soil relative displacement developing at the disturbed soil around the pile shaft and the elastic vertical soil displacement developing in the soil mass. The relationship between the shaft displacement and the skin friction is then presented. Moreover, a hyperbolic model is also used to capture the relationship between end resistance and pile end displacement. Considering the interactive effect among piles, hyperbolic models of an individual pile in pile groups are proposed. As to the analysis of the response of a single pile and pile groups, considering the progressive deformation of the pile–soil system, a highly effective iterative computer program is developed using the proposed hyperbolic models. Comparisons of the load–settlement responses demonstrate that the proposed method is generally in good agreement with the field-observed behavior and the calculated results derived from other approaches.},

abstract = {We investigate the ratio Rrp of the free surface velocity to the shock-state particle velocity during shock wave loading with molecular dynamics simulations on two representativ e solids, single crystal Cu, and silica glass. The free surface velocity is obtained as a function of the particle velocity behind the shock front (or shock stress) for loading on Cu along 〈 100 〉, 〈 110 〉, and 〈 111 〉, and on the isotropic glass. Rrp 1 for Cu and Rrp  {\textless} 1 for silica glass, and it increases with shock strength; the simulations agree well with the experimental results. For supported shock loading of silica glass at 30-90 GPa, the SiIV - SiVI transition occurs upon shock, inducing substantial densification and thus small Rrp (0.65-0.78). For single crystal Cu, Rrp deviates from 1 near the Hugoniot elastic limit and reaches ∼1.2 at 355 GPa for 〈 100 〉 shock. Rrp is anisotropic, e.g., it is about 1.02, 1.08, and 1.06 for shock loading to about 80 GPa along 〈 100 〉, 〈 110 〉, and 〈 111 〉, respectively. Such an anisotropy is mostly due to that in the degree of stress relaxation at low pressures and that in solid state disordering at high pressures. These results suggest that Rrp is materials dependent and the assumption of Rrp =1 is only valid in a limited stress range. Caution should be exercised when interpreting the free surface velocity measurements as regards the shock states. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {A new finite element model based on a large strain formulation has been developed to study cone penetration in normally consolidated sand. An auto-adaptive remeshing technique was utilized for handling the very large distortion of sand surrounding the cone tip. A frictional contact interface utilizing Mohr-Coulomb's theory was chosen to represent interactions between the surface of the cone and sand. To model the sand behaviour, the non-associated Drucker-Prager constitutive model was selected. ABAQUS, a commercial finite element software package, was used to implement the model. The explicit solution algorithm was chosen due to its effectiveness for complicated contact problems. Analysis results proved that the model succesfully captured the cone penetration behavior in sand. In addition, a chart to predict internal friction angles based on cone tip resistance for different vertical effective stresses was provided. This paper also shows a typical distribution of sleeve resistance, tip resistance-penetration relationship, and typical contours of vertical, horizontal, and shear stresses in normally consolidated sand. Finally, a non-uniform resistance was found along the length of the friction sleeve. {\textcopyright} 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The behaviour ofsands during loading has been studied in great detail. However, little work has been devoted to understanding the response ofsands in unloading. Drained triaxial tests indicate that, contrary to the expected elastic behaviour, sand often exhibit contractive behaviour when unloaded. Undrained cyclic simple shear tests show that the triaxial increase in pore water pressure generated during the unloading cycle often exceeds that generated during loading. The tendency to contract upon unloading is important in engineering practice as an increase in pore water pressure during earthquake loading could result in liquefaction. This research contributes to filling the gap in our understanding of soil behaviour in unloading and subsequent reloading. The approach followed includes both theoretical investigation and numerical implementation ofexperimental observations of stress-dilatancy in unload-reload loops. The theoretical investigation is done at the micro-mechanical level. The numerical approach is developed from observations from drained triaxial compression tests. The numerical implementation ofyield in unloading uses NorSand — a hardening plasticity model based on the critical state theory, and extends upon previous understanding. The proposed model is calibrated to Erksak sand and then used to predict the load-unload-reload behaviour ofFraser River sand. The trends predicted from the theoretical and numerical approaches match the experimental observations closely. Shear strength is not highly affected by unload-reload loops. Conversely, volumetric changes as a result ofunloading-reloading are dramatic. Volumetric strains in unloading depend on the last value ofstress ratio (q/p') in the previous loading. It appears that major changes in particles arrangement occur once peak stress ratio is exceeded. The developed unload-reload model requires three additional input parameters, which were correlated to the monotonic parameters, to representhardening in unloading and reloading and the effect ofinduced fabric changes on stress-dilatancy. The calibrated model gave accurate predictions for the results of triaxial tests with load-unload-reload cycles on Fraser River sand.},

abstract = {Soil behavior is complex and thus requires quantification by a reasonably good number of different engineering parameters. Consequently, the seismic piezocone test (SCPTu) is particularly well- suited to being an efficient and economical tool for routine site characterization because four independ- ent readings are obtained with depth by a single sounding: qt, fs, u2, and Vs. An overview on using all four of these separate measurements for evaluating soil engineering parameters is given, realizing in some cases that redundancy occurs when two or more readings are used to interpret the same geomateri- al parameter. The assessment of parameters and subsurface information herein includes: unit weight, soil type, relative density of sands, effective stress peak friction angle, undrained shear strength, effective yield stress, and stiffness},

abstract = {The interaction between a soil layer and an end bearing pile is theoretically investigated. The pile is assumed to be vertical and elastic, the soil is considered as a linear visco-elastic layer with hysteretic type damping. The layer alone is solved first and the wave modes of the layer are used in the analysis of the pile response. The pile response to a harmonic load is obtained in a closed form and used to define stiffness and damping at the level of the pile head. The dimensionless parameters of the problem are identified. A parametric study is conducted to determine the main features of the response and of the equivalent stiffness and damping. The validity of equivalent viscous damping is examined. A comparison is made with the simpler plane strain theory used previously and its accuracy is assessed.},

abstract = {Since the eastern Sicily has been struck by various disastrous earthquakes with a MKS intensity from IX to XI in the last 900 years, an investigation program was performed in different test sites to evaluate the dynamic clayey soils behaviour. The following dynamic investigations in the laboratory were carried out on undisturbed samples: Resonant Column Tests (RCT), Cyclic Loading Torsional Shear Tests (CLTST) and Cyclic Loading Triaxial Tests (CLTxT). The influence of the type of tests, of the strain rate and of the number of loading cycles on G-? and D-? curves, as well as on pore pressure build-up, was evaluated by means of laboratory tests. Moreover in situ investigations were carried out in order to determine the soil profile and the geotechnical characteristics for the site under consideration. Borings, Standard Penetration Test (SPT), Cone Penetration Test (CPT), Down Hole (DH) Tests and new Seismic Marchetti Dilatometer Tests (SDMT) were performed. The available data enabled one to obtain a comparison between the small strain shear modulus (DH, SDMT and laboratory tests) for the specific site. It was also possible to compare in situ and laboratory small strain shear and the G-? curve for soil non-linearity evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer.},

However, existing formulas do not consider soil or pile type, and do not, in general, reliably predict pile capacity. In this paper, an advanced model for dynamic pile driving analysis was used to develop accurate pile driving formulas. The proposed driving formulas are validated through well-documented case histories. Comparisons of predictions from the proposed formulas with results from static and dynamic load tests show that they produce reasonably accurate predictions of pile capacity based on pile set observations.},

From a heuristic approach, a method is proposed to identify possible consolidation effects taking place during penetration using the velocity factor, Vh. Defined as a direct function of probe size, d, penetration rate, v, and dissipation time, t50, the dimensionless velocity factor Vh is used to demonstrate that normalisation of cone penetration velocity is an important step for assessment of soil properties and for comparative performance of data from different geomaterials. An application is reported to illustrate the normalisation of measured data in soils within the permeability range from 10-5 to 10-8 m/s.},

The ALE method is then employed to perform a parametric study of a perfectly smooth penetrometer free-falling into a uniform layer of clay, which deforms under undrained conditions. The effect of the mechanical properties of the clay soil on the penetration characteristics is presented, and an approximate, closed-form expression is derived for the dynamic penetration factor, Ndp: Comparisons are made between the deduced values of Ndp and published values of the conventional cone factor, Nc, and comparisons are made with experimental data to validate the approach.},

De m{\^{e}}me, ces appareils fournissent tr{\`{e}}s peu d'information, notamment la r{\'{e}}sistance de pointe qd ; qui n'est pas un param{\`{e}}tre intrins{\`{e}}que du sol. Par ailleurs, le ph{\'{e}}nom{\`{e}}ne du battage reste toujours expliqu{\'{e}} par la th{\'{e}}orie de chocs de Newton, alors qu'on sait qu'il n'est pas un simple probl{\`{e}}me pouvant {\^{e}}tre expliqu{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'aide de cette th{\'{e}}orie. C'est pour r{\'{e}}pondre {\`{a}} ces besoins qu'il a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}} un nouveau p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre dynamique {\'{e}}quip{\'{e}} de diff{\'{e}}rents capteurs permettant, par le biais du traitement et de l'analyse des signaux enregistr{\'{e}}s lors d'un choc, d'obtenir les param{\`{e}}tres gouvernant le comportement « effort-d{\'{e}}formation » du sol pendant l'enfoncement de la pointe. Il s'agit du p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre Panda 3. Le principe de mesure est simple et consiste {\`{a}} enregistrer et {\`{a}} d{\'{e}}coupler les ondes cr{\'{e}}{\'{e}}es par l'impact du marteau sur la t{\^{e}}te de l'appareil et {\`{a}} calculer ensuite la force, l'acc{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}ration et la vitesse subies en pointe. Ceci nous permettre de tracer la courbe charge-enfoncement pour chaque coup fourni lors du battage. L'exploitation de cette courbe permet de d{\'{e}}terminer des param{\`{e}}tres de r{\'{e}}sistance (qd, qc) et de d{\'{e}}formation du sol tels que la c{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}rit{\'{e}} des ondes (Vp et Vs), le module p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}trique (Ep) et l'amortissement de Smith (Js).

Toutefois {\`{a}} l'heure actuelle des essais in-situ n'ont pas {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} tr{\`{e}}s exploit{\'{e}}s. En effet, le d{\'{e}}veloppement d'un nouvel appareillage comprend non seulement le montage de l'appareil en lui-m{\^{e}}me et l'{\'{e}}tude au laboratoire, mais aussi des {\'{e}}tudes pr{\'{e}}alables de faisabilit{\'{e}}, de validation et des propositions des modes op{\'{e}}ratoires in-situ. L'objectif de ce travail c'est ainsi de valider la pertinence in-situ de cet essai et de valider la coh{\'{e}}rence des r{\'{e}}sultats obtenus par le biais d'un comparatif avec d'autres essais.

abstract = {OBJECT: The authors conducted a prospective longitudinal study to assess the efficacy of ProDisc arthroplasty in patients in whom symptomatic adjacent-segment degeneration has developed after remote lumbar fusion. The follow-up period was a minimum of 2 years. METHODS: The 20 patients in this study ranged in age from 18 to 67 years. They presented with disabling adjacent-level discogenic low-back pain with or without L1-S1 radicular pain. Patients with radiographic evidence of circumferential spinal stenosis or facet joint degeneration had been excluded. Patients were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Eighteen patients (90{\%}) fulfilled all follow-up criteria. The median age of all patients was 50 years. Statistical improvements in visual analog scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and patient satisfaction scores were documented 3 months after arthroplasty. These improvements remained at the 24-month follow-up examinations. Patient satisfaction rates were 86{\%} at 24 months. Radicular pain was also significantly decreased. No additional surgeries were necessary at affected or unaffected levels. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of early results indicates that ProDisc lumbar total disc arthroplasty is an efficacious treatment for symptomatic adjacent-segment lumbar discogenic low-back pain following remote fusion. Significant improvements in patient satisfaction and disability scores were observed by 3 months postoperatively and were maintained at the 2-year follow-up examination. No device-related complications occurred. Patients should be screened carefully for evidence of facet joint impingement/degeneration, hardware-induced pain, and/or nonunion at prior fusion levels before undergoing disc replacement surgery.},

The method uses the discrete element method (DEM) and in a single model is able to assess the installation requirements as well as the ultimate tensile and compressive capacity. Numerical modelling of screw piles has traditionally been conducted using finite element analysis (FEA), in which piles are wished in place into a soil body consisting of a meshed continuum. Although this has provided many insights into the capacity of screw piles and the mechanisms that form when they are loaded, they do not usually consider the effects of installation on the behaviour of the soil. Using 3D DEM calibrated against element tests and geotechnical centrifuge tests, it is now possible to assess the local changes in density and stress caused during the installation process and what effects this has on the capacity of screw piles.},

Consequently, one cannot cover it extensively and the present chapter will address three selected topics that were discussed during the lecture series given at CISM. For those subjects, the main experimental tool is the Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB, Kolsky apparatus), used in its two or one bar version. The SHPB is extensively covered in another chapter so that we will assume that the reader is reasonably familiar with this technique, and will focus here on selected applications, noting that the SHPB is, before anything else, an experimental setup that allows for determination of the boundary conditions (load, displacements) applied to a structure (a specimen being in that case a special case of structure). The following topics will be addressed: Dynamic fracture of materials: Here we will present the one-point impact technique and its applications to both fracture mechanics testing, and also to dynamic tensile testing of quasi-brittle materials. Pressure sensitivity of materials: We will describe the basic technique and its application to metallic and polymeric materials, with selected results. Thermomechanical couplings: We will address here the effect itself, followed by various experimental techniques to measure transient temperature changes in impacted solids, followed by selected results. As alluded before, such a chapter cannot be extensive, and is based mostly on the author's experience. However, we will outline throughout the text relevant references that will allow the reader to expand his knowledge on the field.},

abstract = {The state parameter concept provides a new method of characterizing sand behaviour, but the utility of the concept relies on the ability to measure the state parameter in situ. Part I of this Paper demonstrated a relationship between normalized cone resistance and state parameter for Monterey sand. In this Paper the state parameter approach is applied to data from calibration chamber tests on several sands. It is shown that this approach leads to a common relationship for all the data that includes the effects of material type, quantified by the slope of the steady state line. The state parameter for a sand can therefore be determined in situ with a reasonable precision using a general framework of interpretation which applies to all uncemented sands.

abstract = {The potential error due to friction in compression split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) tests is assessed and conditions for minimising this error are investigated. Theoretical friction factors are inferred from ring compression tests. Experimental results are reported for mild steel, copper and aluminium ring specimens tested quasi-statically (∼10-2 s-1), using a servo-hydraulic test machine, and at high strain rates (∼103 s-1) on a SHPB. Specimens were tested dry, or lubricated using a molybdenum disulphide grease. The influence of surface finish and strain rate on the friction effect is discussed. The inferred friction factors are in the range m=0.08-0.14 (equivalent to Coulomb friction coefficients between $\mu$=0.05 and 0.08). These results imply that the friction error in routine compression SHPB tests of metals lies between 2{\%} and 3{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a mechanical analogue which models the response of a rigid circular footing on an ideal elastoplastic half‐space to transient loads. In the rational analysis of pile‐driving dynamics, the response of soil at the base of a pile is often approximated by a footing on a semi‐infinite half‐space. Most existing base models employ the well‐known Lysmer analogue to model the elastic response of the soil at the pile base, and account for the inelastic soil behaviour through the inclusion of a plastic slider with a slip load equal to the ultimate failure load of the footing. The improved model provides a force response which is significantly closer to the ideal response than existing models. The paper commences with a review of analytical solutions for the dynamic response of a rigid circular footing on an elastic half‐space. Existing mechanical analogs for the system are reviewed, and an automatic matching process proposed which improves the accuracy of the analogs under transient loading. The inelastic response is then studied using the finite element method, and the mechanical analogs are modified to allow representation of the observed inelastic behaviour. Examples are presented illustrating close agreement between the proposed models and finite element analyses for a range of Poisson's ratio. The improved models have direct application for one‐dimensional models of pile driving, particularly in the back‐analysis of data from dynamic testing of piles. They are also applicable to studies of dynamic compaction. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd},

Toutefois, l'utilisation pour cela des p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tres dynamiques dans le monde a augment{\'{e}} ces 20 derni{\`{e}}res ann{\'{e}}es. En France, par exemple, d{\`{e}}s les ann{\'{e}}es 90 cette technique de contr{\^{o}}le est devenue une pratique habituelle et normalis{\'{e}}e. Parmi ces outils, le p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre PANDA{\textregistered} (Gourves, 1991) est le plus largement utilis{\'{e}}. Le principe fondamental du PANDA{\textregistered} consiste {\`{a}} enfoncer par battage manuel dans le sol un train de tiges muni d'une pointe conique {\`{a}} son extr{\'{e}}mit{\'{e}} inf{\'{e}}rieure. Pour chaque impact, la p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}tration (e) et la r{\'{e}}sistance de pointe (qd) sont enregistr{\'{e}}es et report{\'{e}}es en fonction de la profondeur (z). La courbe qd(z) obtenue est dite p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trogramme. Le contr{\^{o}}le du compactage au moyen du PANDA{\textregistered} s'appuie sur la comparaison du p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trogramme qd(z) obtenu in situ avec l'ensemble des courbes de r{\'{e}}f{\'{e}}rence relatives au sol contr{\^{o}}l{\'{e}}. Ces derni{\`{e}}res sont regroup{\'{e}}es dans un catalogue de r{\'{e}}f{\'{e}}rence disponible pour diff{\'{e}}rents sols, leurs {\'{e}}tats hydriques et les objectifs de compactage. Ce catalogue a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} {\'{e}}labor{\'{e}} au laboratoire {\`{a}} partir de la calibration du PANDA{\textregistered} pour une trentaine de sols GTR diff{\'{e}}rents, dans des {\'{e}}tats de compacit{\'{e}} et d'humidit{\'{e}} variables (Chaigneau, 2001). En effet, (Chaigneau, 2001) a d{\'{e}}montr{\'{e}}, en s'appuyant sur l'approche micro-m{\'{e}}canique type "Biarez-Favre", que pour un sol et un {\'{e}}tat hydrique donn{\'{e}}, il existe une relation biunivoque entre la densit{\'{e}} s{\`{e}}che (d) et la r{\'{e}}sistance de pointe (qd). Cette relation est repr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}e au moyen d'une courbe d{\'{e}}finie par l'expression logarithmique (d) = A * (1/w) +B*ln (qd) +C. Les valeurs de A, B et C repr{\'{e}}sentent les constantes de r{\'{e}}gression de cette relation. En suivant les m{\^{e}}mes hypoth{\`{e}}ses que (Chaigneau, 2001) et en s'appuyant sur les travaux de Biarez et Favre, on admet que les param{\`{e}}tres A, B et C sont fonction des propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}s physiques, d'{\'{e}}tat et d'interaction des sols. L'objectif de ce travail est de d{\'{e}}velopper un mod{\`{e}}le math{\'{e}}matique permettant de trouver les relations qui lient les constantes de r{\'{e}}gression A, B et C aux caract{\'{e}}ristiques granulom{\'{e}}triques, d'{\'{e}}tat, hydrique et plastique du sol. Pour ce faire, cette {\'{e}}tude s'appuie sur une base de donn{\'{e}}es (BDD) compos{\'{e}}e de divers types de sols, pour lesquels on dispose des courbes de calibration pour diff{\'{e}}rents degr{\'{e}}s de compactage et d'humidit{\'{e}}. Ce travail a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}} en 4 phases, int{\'{e}}grant quelques concepts statistiques, math{\'{e}}matiques et des notions de base de la m{\'{e}}canique de sols. Dans un premier temps un {\'{e}}tat de l'art est pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}} concernant les sols et leurs propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}s physiques, d'{\'{e}}tat et d'interaction. En deuxi{\`{e}}me temps, la BDD, outil principal de ce travail, est pass{\'{e}}e en revue et compl{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}e. Par la suite on {\'{e}}tudie par le biais de l'{\'{e}}tablissement de matrices de corr{\'{e}}lations les relations pouvant exister entre les valeurs A, B et C et les param{\`{e}}tres caract{\'{e}}ristiques des sols de la BDD. La validation des mod{\`{e}}les propos{\'{e}}s est r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}}e exp{\'{e}}rimentalement pour de sols appartenant {\`{a}} la BDD, mais aussi pour de nouveaux sols. Une comparaison des courbes de calibration mesur{\'{e}}es au laboratoire et celles estim{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} partir des mod{\`{e}}les pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}s est ainsi effectu{\'{e}}e.

abstract = {Static pile load test to failure is the ultimate procedure available to examine the capacity and integrity of deep foundations. Being expensive and time-consuming, the procedure is often substituted for the application of a load to a certain factor (most often two) times the contemplated design load. In fact, only a proof test is carried out while the ultimate capacity and actual factor of safety remains unknown. This procedure results in an uneconomic foundation solution, unknown capacity when modifications are required, and the inability of the engineer to gain insight into the controlling mechanism for improved design. The described state of the practice calls for the ability to reliably estimate the ultimate bearing pile capacity for non-failed load tests. A practical analytical method is proposed, capable of extrapolating the measured load-settlement relations beyond the maximum tested load. The proposed procedure, along with two other possible methods, is evaluated. The procedures are examined through a database of 63 driven piles load-tested to failure. Loading is assumed to be known for only 25{\%}, 33{\%}, 50{\%}, 75{\%}, and 100{\%} of the actual bearing capacity (typically lower than the maximum applied load), and separately for 25{\%}, 33{\%}, 50{\%}, 75{\%}, and 100{\%} of the entire load-settlement data points. The limited "known" data is then extrapolated using the different methods and the obtained bearing capacity is compared to the actual measurements. For consistency, only one failure criterion (Davisson) is applied. The obtained results are analyzed statistically to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the three methods. It is shown that the accuracy of the proposed method is 0.99 +/- 0.21 (1S.D.), 0.96 +/- 0.27, 0.87 +/- 0.30, and 0.78 +/- 0.33 when assuming 75{\%}, 50{\%}, 33{\%}, and 25{\%} of the data points to be known and 0.99 +/- 0.26 (1S.D.), 0.89 +/- 0.41, 0.74 +/- 0.46, and 0.64 +/- 0.44 when assuming 75{\%}, 50{\%}, 33{\%}, and 25{\%} of the bearing capacity to be known, respectively. The obtained results for the 63 database cases suggest that even when the predicted ultimate capacity is four times the maximum actual tested load, the associated risk is zero for exceeding the design load, when using the extrapolated value with a factor of safety of 2.0. All the case histories used in this research relate to driven piles. Even though it is expected to be valid, a detailed examination of the method is required before its safe application to cast-in-place piles. Case history analyses of six load-tested driven piles at two sites are presented. The analyzed cases indicate possible substantial savings when the ultimate capacity well exceeds the maximum applied load. Moreover, the method already demonstrates its enormous importance from aspects of engineering and economics.},

abstract = {The reported compressional wave speed dispersion and attenuation could be explained by a modified gap stiffness model incorporated into the Biot model (the BIMGS model). In contrast, shear wave speed dispersion and attenuation have not been investigated in detail. No measurements of shear wave speed dispersion have been reported, and only Brunson's data provide the frequency characteristics of shear wave attenuation. In this study, Brunson's attenuation measurements are compared to predictions using the Biot-Stoll model and the BIMGS model. It is shown that the BIMGS model accurately predicts the frequency dependence of shear wave attenuation. Then, the shear wave speed dispersion and attenuation in water-saturated silica sand are measured in the frequency range of 4-20 kHz. The vertical stress applied to the sample is 17.6 kPa. The temperature of the sample is set to be 5 °C, 20 °C, and 35 °C in order to change the relaxation frequency in the BIMGS model. The measured results are compared with those calculated using the Biot-Stoll model and the BIMGS model. It is shown that the shear wave speed dispersion and attenuation are predicted accurately by using the BIMGS model.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers. In this study, axisymmetric numerical modeling of continuous impact pile driving from the ground surface to the final depth of pile installation was successfully conducted using arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) adaptive mesh method. To verify the generated ground vibrations remarkably better with field data compared to previous numerical models, the pile-soil interaction was significantly improved, and all prevalent simplified assumptions were ignored as well. Then, the variation of PPV, the maximum experienced velocity of a soil particle known as peak particle velocity, in different ground depths was meticulously investigated, and it was concluded that PPV can occur in ground depths rather than the ground surface after a threshold radial distance from the pile centerline. The PPV at radial distances more than 8 m and depth of 1 m was between 5 and 15{\%} greater than the values recorded at the ground surface. Moreover, critical depth of vibration was investigated, and it was observed that penetration of a pile up to more than its half-length guarantees PPV occurrence at all radial distances. Finally, a series of extensive parametric studies were carried out in which hammer impact force, pile diameter, tip angle, and damping ratio of soil were concluded as the factors most affecting the ground vibrations induced by impact pile driving.},

abstract = {Titanium diboride (TiB2) has excellent mechanical properties, and is expected to be used as crashworthy material. In this study, the Hugoniot-measurements were performed on the TiB2 polycrystal by means of the inclined-mirror method combined with the powder gun and two-stage gas gun to study the elastoplastic transition and to search phase transition. The Hugoniot-elastic limit (HEL) stress was measured to be approximately 12 GPa. The shock velocity (US) vs. particle velocity (UP) relation of the final phase was given by US=8.79+0.78UPkm/s in the plastic region of 0.6-3.0 km/s in particle velocity. The shock velocities were much large compared with the bulk sound velocity, and those in 0.24-0.6 km/s were further larger than the linear Hugoniot relation. This result showed that this material preserved the large shear strength also in the plastic region. No phase transition was observed up to 120 GPa. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A novel blast wave mitigation device was investigated experimentally in this paper. The device consists of a piston-cylinder assembly. A shock wave is induced within the cylinder when a blast wave impacts on the piston. The shock wave propagates inside the device and is reflected repeatedly. The shock wave propagation process inside the device lengthens the duration of the force on the base of the device to several orders of magnitude of the duration of the blast wave, while it decreases the maximum pressure by several orders of magnitude. Two types of experiments were carried out to study the blast wave mitigation device. The first type of experiments was done with honeycomb structures protected by the blast wave mitigation device. Experimental results show that the device can adequately protect the honeycomb structure. A second type of experiments was done using a Hopkinson bar to measure the pressure transmitted through the blast wave mitigation device. The experimental results agree well with results from a theoretical model. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 by ASME.},

abstract = {The Cone Loading Test (CLT) consists in stopping the static penetration at a desired level and carrying out a loading of the cone by successive steps. Measurement of the settlement of a cone submitted to incremental loading allows the determination of a modulus correlated to those obtained using laboratory tests or derived from other in situ tests. This test can be carried out with standard static penetrometer equipment. Considering that the cone of the penetrometer is a reduced model pile, a direct outcome of the CLT test is its ability to be a tool for foundation design. For this purpose, a direct method using the cone resistance and limit sleeve friction of the CLT test was proposed to calculate the bearing capacity and predicting the settlement of a pile. This method is a new approach to transform the CLT test curves of cone loading and friction mobilization in load-displacement curve of a pile (t-z curves).},

In order to support geotechnical engineers with soil model parameter selection, empirical formulas have been developed to derive the model parameters of the Plaxis Hardening Soil model with small-strain stiffness (HSsmall), on the basis of a characteristic property (relative density for sands and plasticity index for clays). This paper shows a validation of formulas for sands which have been derived from published soil testing data. The main goal of the empirical formulas is to give a reasonable first order approximation of soil behaviour in FEM calculations, covering a wide range of sands. In a case study it is demonstrated that the empirical formulas work reasonably well to get a first estimate of deformations and stress developments for a real project. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, London.},

The case of a pile advanced by expansion will be compared to a similar pile subjected to computational driving (referred to, respectively, as 'expanded' and 'driven' piles for convenience). The state of stress and deformation, and the evolution of pore-water pressure in the soil will be monitored for the expanded and driven piles. Further computational driving will be applied to both cases and the pile response and soil resistance will be compared.

abstract = {The piezocone is one of the most widely used in-situ tools with which to characterise the soil profile, distinguishing different types of sediment, and to provide quantitative data on the soil strength and consolidation characteristics. For fine-grained soils where penetration occurs under nominally undrained conditions, consolidation characteristics are obtained from dissipation tests conducted with the piezocone brought to rest. Dissipation testing is interpreted to yield a coefficient of consolidation, by comparison of the excess pore pressure decay with theoretical solutions. It is generally acknowledged that the coefficient of consolidation derived from in-situ dissipation tests will be greater, by a factor of perhaps 2 to 10, than values derived from oedometer tests on samples recovered from the corresponding depth. Apart from potential differences in horizontal and vertical permeability, differences arise from the influence of the rigidity index on the initial excess pore pressure field and the more complex stress paths undergone by soil elements surrounding the piezocone by comparison with an oedometer test. In order to advance the science underlying interpretation of dissipation testing, a careful parametric study has been undertaken using finite-element analysis, with the soil modeled as modified Cam Clay. The aim has been to derive an ‘operative' coefficient of consolidation, linked to the consolidation and swelling parameters of the soil model, thus allowing quantitative treatment of the difference in coefficients of consolidation derived from laboratory oedometer or in-situ dissipation testing. The effect of partial consolidation during the penetration phase is also considered.},

Validations show that this new EOS can well describe the pressure-volume data of porous materials over a wide range of porosity and pressure. In particular, the abnormal expansion is satisfactorily reproduced. Furthermore, based on the new EOS, a unified functional form of the EOS is deduced to describe the shock, isentropic, and isothermal compression of solid materials, which facilitates the mutual calculation among different kinds of compression states.},

Germanium fits these requirements and has been proposed as a high-mobility channel material,[1] a light emitting medium in silicon-integrated lasers,[2,3] and a plasmonic conductor for bio-sensing.[4,5] Common to these diverse applications is the need for homogeneous, high electron densities in three-dimensions (3D). Here we use a bottom-up approach to demonstrate the 3D assembly of atomically sharp doping profiles in germanium by a repeated stacking of two-dimensional (2D) high-density phosphorus layers. This produces high-density (10{\^{}}19 to 10{\^{}}20 cm-3) low-resistivity (10{\^{}}-4 Ohmcm) metallic germanium of precisely defined thickness, beyond the capabilities of diffusion-based doping technologies.[6] We demonstrate that free electrons from distinct 2D dopant layers coalesce into a homogeneous 3D conductor using anisotropic quantum interference measurements, atom probe tomography, and density functional theory.},

The numerical model was developed with solid elements for both the pile and the surrounding soil. Interfaces are created both on the inside and outside surfaces of the pipe pile along the length as well as at the bottom of the annular area of the pile. The pile driving was simulated by giving hammer impact force of one blow which was measured during offshore pile installation. Parametric studies were performed with different soil properties until the signals from the numerical analyses matched with the measured force–velocity data of the pile installed in offshore South East Asia region. The results include the soil plug behaviour under continuous driving and with a delay time of 12 h.},

abstract = {There are many equations available in the literature using the results of CPT (cone penetration test) and SPT (standard penetration test) measurements to predict the end bearing capacity of drilled shafts in sand. However, there are few equations that use soil parameters, such as friction angle and elastic modulus, as input values. Also, these available equations usually overestimate the end bearing capacity, and at times show conflicting results with respect to the parameters they use. This paper describes a numerical procedure to overcome the above shortcomings. The results obtained in this study were compared with both experimental and numerical results available in the literature. A series of analyses is also conducted to assess the effects of various soil and pile parameters on the magnitude of end bearing capacity of piles embedded in sand. These parameters include diameter and length of pile, friction angle, and Poisson's ratio of soil. Based on the numerical analyses carried out in this study, a new equation is proposed to estimate the end bearing capacity of drilled shafts in sands. The results of the proposed equation are also compared with experimental data available in the literature on end bearing capacity of drilled shafts. The comparison shows better agreement of the suggested end bearing capacity equation with respect to other previously proposed methods.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {This study explores the effect of stress state on small-strain modulus (G max) in the naturally occurring Ganga sand and silt using bender elements during a series of carefully performed undrained triaxial tests. Unlike previous studies with drained shearing or testing of dry samples, the undrained shearing is chosen here to decouple the effects of void ratio and stress state on the small-strain stiffness. The results from undrained shearing of anisotropically and isotropically consolidated medium dense sand specimens are compared by keeping the same relative density and matching the initial mean effective pressure. The measured G max values show stress path dependency-that is, it is a function of both mean effective stress and deviatoric stress. This behaviour of G max is captured well by a non-linear isotropic model following the energy conservation principle, which incorporates the effect of both mean effective stress and deviatoric stress. The stress-strain response of soil provides some interesting observations, such as the strain hardening occurs mostly at constant effective stress ratio and the stress ratio at phase transition varies with the effective confinement. Experiments with varying silt content in the sand indicate that higher fines content results in slightly lower G max values, mainly due to the lower values of mean effective stress and deviatoric stress during undrained shearing.},

There are existing methods to estimate soil unit weight based on soil behavior type (SBT) derived from CPT results. Methods have also been developed to estimate soil unit weight using shear wave velocity and DMT results. Using links between shear wave velocity and CPT results, as well as links between CPT and DMT results, a new correlation is proposed to estimate soil unit weight based directly on CPT results (qt and fs). The resulting correlation is evaluated using published case records and appears to provide reasonable estimates of soil unit weight.},

abstract = {Dynamic properties of soils at very small strains are of particular interest for geotechnical engineers for the characterization of the behaviour of earth structures subjected to a variety of static and dynamic stress states. This study reports on the small-strain dynamic properties of silty sand with particular emphasis on the effect of non-plastic fines content on the small-strain shear modulus (Gmax) and material damping (Ds,min). Several clean sands with a wide range of grain size distribution and particle shape are mixed with different percentages of a silica non-plastic silt. The laboratory created samples are subjected to torsional resonant column tests with small-strain shear moduli and damping ratios measured along an isotropic stress path. It is shown that at low percentages of fines content, there is a significant difference between the dynamic properties of the various samples due to the different characteristics of the sand portion of the mixtures. However this variance diminishes as the fines content increases and the soil behaviour becomes mainly silt-dominant, rendering no significant influence of different sand properties on the small-strain shear modulus and damping ratio. Using the experimental results, new expressions for the prediction of small-strain shear modulus and small-strain damping ratio of non-plastic silty sands are developed accounting for the percentage of silt and the characteristics of the sand portion.},

In addition to KRS characterisation, physical and mechanical properties of soil-KRS mixtures are also obtained and compared. Also, microstructural and chemical investigation based on Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) were performed in selected mixtures to infer about the KRS stabilisation process. Results show that KRS was able to stabilise the two different soils selected in this study, but the efficiency is dependent on the type of soil used. The chemical stabilisation seems to be the main mechanism to promote soil mixture resistance gain, and it might occur due to KRS compounds and clay mineral interactions. KRS could be a promising alternative to stabilise low quality clay soils for roadway application, bringing significant environmental and economic gains.},

Cette forme certifi{\'{e}}e et garantie du capital culturel permet de poser le probl{\`{e}}me des fonctions sociales du syst{\`{e}}me d'enseignement et d'appr{\'{e}}hender pratiquement les relations qu'il entretient avec le syst{\`{e}}me {\'{e}}conomique.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe Three Stages of Cultural Capital.$\backslash$nThe concept of cultural endowment was developed to account for inequalities in academic performance, by stressing the inequality in the way in which the tools for the appropriation of cultural assets such as works of art were distributed.$\backslash$nThe diverse properties of this cultural endowment are literally 'incorporated'; that is, interiorised in the form of a set of permanent and lasting attitudes. The capital itself is in a sense identified with individuals; its accumulation requires time, which is a social asset that can not be acquired by proxy; it demands a personal investment of energy; the biological limitations of its System of maintenance are the limitations to its own capacity for accumulation. These specific properties, which are seen as being linked to the individual, enhance the advantages of the system of inheritance by having both the appearance of something in-born and at the same time acquired. This means that 'incorporated' cultural capital becomes the predilect means of the legitimate transmission of the human heritage at times when direct and visible forms of transmission fall into disfavour.$\backslash$nCultural assets (books, paintings, machines), which are the objectified counterpart to cultural capital, are transmissible immediately and may be appropriated formally as material objects. But in any one case of their transmission, they are subject to the same strictures as apply to 'incorporated' cultural capital.$\backslash$nA last instance of cultural capital is that of academic qualifications. These, like coins, are relatively independent in value of their bearers. This certified and guaranteed form of cultural capital raises the whole question of the social functions of the educational system and may lead into a practical awareness of the relationship between cultural capital and the economic system.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDie drei Zust{\"{a}}nde des kulturellen Kapitals.$\backslash$nDer Begriff des 'kulturellen Kapitals' wurde entwickelt in Hinblick auf die Erhellung und Darlegung ungleicher schulischer Performanzen; dabei wurde der Akzent von Anbeginn auf die klassen-spezifische ungleiche Verteilung der zur Aneignung kultureller G{\"{u}}ter (z.B. Kunstwerke) notwendigen Instrumente gelegt. Die in inkorporiertem Zustand, d.h. in der verinnerlichten Form einer st{\"{a}}ndigen und dauerhaften Disposition (Habitus) vorliegenden Eigenschaften des kulturellen Kapitals sind praktisch darauf zuruckzuf{\"{u}}hren, da{\ss} es sich dabei um eine an das Individuum gebundene Form von Kapital handelt : seine Akkumulation erfordert Zeit, ein soziales Gut, das nur schwer kraft Vollmacht zu erlangen ist; es erfordert pers{\"{o}}nliche Investition; seine Akkumulation ist begrenzt durch die biologischen Grenzen seines Tr{\"{a}}gers, etc. Diese als persongebunden wahrgenommenen besonderen Eigenschaften, die zu den Vorteilen des Erbes noch den Schein des Angeborenen und die Tugenden des Erworbenen hinzuf{\"{u}}gen, lassen das inkorporierte kulturelle Kapital gerade in Zeiten, da die direkten und sichtbaren Formen der Weitergabe tendenziell der gesellschaftlichen {\"{A}}chtung als illegitim verfallen, als legitimstes Mittel der Weitergabe des Erbes erscheinen.$\backslash$nDie kulturellen G{\"{u}}ter (B{\"{u}}cher, Bilder, Maschinen), kulturelles Kapital in objektiviertem Zustand, sind zwar sofort vermittelbar und in ihrer Materialit{\"{a}}t f{\"{o}}rmlich aneigenbar, doch unterliegen die Bedingungen ihrer spezifischen Aneignung den gleichen Gesetzen der Weitergabe wie das inkorporierte kulturelle Kapital.$\backslash$nSchlie{\ss}1ich kann das kulturelle Kapital auch in institutionalisierter Form als schulische Titel vorliegen, die wie Geld gegen{\"{u}}ber den jeweiligen Titeltr{\"{a}}gern relativ unabh{\"{a}}ngig sind. Diese in Zertifikaten und Diplomen niedergelegte und gesicherte  Form des kulturellen Kapitals erm{\"{o}}glicht nun die Thematisierung der gesellschaftlichen Funktionen des Bildungssy stems und erlaubt dariiberhinaus, die Beziehungen zwischen Bildungs- und Wirtschafts System praktisch zu erfassen.},

abstract = {This Paper describes a simple technique for accurately measuring the mean local axial strains of triaxial samples over a central gauge length. The technique makes use of an axial displacement gauge which is a development of one devised by Burland {\&} Symes (1982) which makes use of electrolytic levels. The device can resolve to less than 1 cm over a range of 15 mm, is simple to mount on the specimen and is not damaged when the sample is taken to failure. The results of undrained triaxial tests are presented for a wide spectrum of soil types ranging from sands through intact, reconstituted and remoulded low plasticity till, undisturbed London clay to intact unweathered chalk. The test results show that conventional external measurements of displacement contain errors which are frequently so large that their use in the determination of soil stiffness at working levels of stress is invalid. The errors mainly result from tilting of the sample, bedding at the end platens and the effects of compliance in the apparatus. Although much more experimental work is required before general conclusions can be drawn about the small strain behaviour of soils the results presented lead to some important observations on the undrained stiffness, linearity and yielding behaviour of soils at small strains. {\textcopyright} 1984, Thomas Telford Ltd.

abstract = {Flooding has a significant impact on road infrastructural development and maintenance. This study was aimed at mitigating the effects of flooding of low-bearing capacity soils, a solution that could alleviate the effects of flooding on road structural layers, especially, those constructed on flood susceptible soils and/or regions. The achievement of such an improvement would foster the growth of road infrastructural development, particularly for low income economies where critical savings accruing from this mitigation effect could be invested in further development projects. Laboratory simulation of flooding was carried out on stabilized soil test specimens. The production of the test specimens involved the use of Lower Oxford Clay (LOC) as a typical low-bearing capacity soil, stabilized using varying proportions of a latently hydraulic industrial by-product material - Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS) - blended with quicklime (CaO) as an activator. Reducing the use of lime by incorporating GGBS enhances sustainability of the proposed process. Cylindrical test specimens of 50. mm in diameter and 100. mm in height were statically compacted to achieve maximum dry density (MDD), prior to moist curing for varying time periods before simulating prolonged flooding. Water absorption was monitored during the flooding process, and the specimens then tested for compressive strength. The results suggest potential of these lime-GGBS-LOC mixtures in overcoming the deleterious effect of flooding, by reduced water absorption and maintenance of a rigid cementing matrix structure after prolonged flooding. This is believed to offer savings from the improved robustness of road structural layers upon flooding, through resource conservation and material durability enhancement. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Salgado2018,
abstract = {Driven piles are commonly used in foundation engineering. The most accurate measurement of pile capacity is achieved from measurements made during static load tests. Static load tests, however, may be too expensive for certain projects. In these cases, indirect estimates of the pile capacity can be made through dynamic measurements. These estimates can be performed either through pile driving formulae or through analytical methods, such as the Case method. Pile driving formulae, which relate the pile set per blow to the capacity of the pile, are frequently used to determine whether the pile has achieved its design capacity. However, existing formulae have numerous shortcomings. These formulae are based on empirical observations and lack scientific validation. This report details the development of more accurate and reliable pile driving formulae developed from advanced one-dimensional FE simulations. These formulae are derived for piles installed in five typical soil profiles: a floating pile in sand, an end‐bearing pile in sand, a floating pile in clay, an end‐bearing pile in clay and a pile crossing a normally consolidated clay layer and resting on a dense sand layer. The proposed driving formulae are validated through well-documented case histories of full-scale instrumented driven piles. The proposed formulae are more accurate and reliable on average than other existing methods for the case histories considered in this study. This report also discusses the development of a pile driving control system, a fully integrated system developed by Purdue that can be used to collect, process, and analyze data to estimate the capacities of piles using the Case method and the pile driving formulae developed at Purdue.},

abstract = {A new constitutive model is introduced which is formulated in the framework of classical theory of plasticity. In the model the total strains are calculated using a stress-dependent stiffness, different for both virgin loading and un-/reloading. The plastic strains are calculated by introducing a multi-surface yield criterion. Hardening is assumed to be isotropic depending on both the plastic shear and volumetric strain. For the frictional hardening a non-associated and for the cap hardening an associated flow rule is assumed. First the model is written in its rate form. Therefor the essential equations for the stiffness modules, the yield-, failure- and plastic potential surfaces are given. In the next part some remarks are given on the models incremental implementation in the Plaxis computer code. The parameters used in the model are summarized, their physical interpretation and determination are explained in detail. The model is calibrated for a loose sand for which a lot of experimental data is available. With the so calibrated model undrained shear tests and pressuremeter tests are back-calculated. The paper ends with some remarks on the limitations of the model and an outlook on further developments.},

Actuellement, il existe diff{\'{e}}rentes m{\'{e}}thodes, directes ou indirectes, permettant de r{\'{e}}aliser ce type de contr{\^{o}}le. Toutefois, l'utilisation pour cela des p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tres dynamiques dans le monde a augment{\'{e}} ces 20 derni{\`{e}}res ann{\'{e}}es. En France, par exemple, d{\`{e}}s les ann{\'{e}}es 90 cette technique de contr{\^{o}}le est devenue une pratique habituelle et normalis{\'{e}}e. Parmi ces outils, le p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre PANDA{\textregistered} (Gourves, 1991) est le plus largement utilis{\'{e}}. Le principe fondamental du PANDA{\textregistered} consiste {\`{a}} enfoncer par battage manuel dans le sol un train de tiges muni d'une pointe conique {\`{a}} son extr{\'{e}}mit{\'{e}} inf{\'{e}}rieure. Pour chaque impact, la p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}tration (e) et la r{\'{e}}sistance de pointe (qd) sont enregistr{\'{e}}es et report{\'{e}}es en fonction de la profondeur (z). La courbe qd(z) obtenue est dite p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trogramme. Le contr{\^{o}}le du compactage au moyen du PANDA{\textregistered} s'appuie sur la comparaison du p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trogramme qd(z) obtenu in situ avec l'ensemble des courbes de r{\'{e}}f{\'{e}}rence relatives au sol contr{\^{o}}l{\'{e}}. Ces derni{\`{e}}res sont regroup{\'{e}}es dans un catalogue de r{\'{e}}f{\'{e}}rence disponible pour diff{\'{e}}rents sols, leurs {\'{e}}tats hydriques et les objectifs de compactage. Ce catalogue a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} {\'{e}}labor{\'{e}} au laboratoire {\`{a}} partir de la calibration du PANDA{\textregistered} pour une trentaine de sols GTR diff{\'{e}}rents, dans des {\'{e}}tats de compacit{\'{e}} et d'humidit{\'{e}} variables (Chaigneau, 2001). En effet, (Chaigneau, 2001) a d{\'{e}}montr{\'{e}}, en s'appuyant sur l'approche micro-m{\'{e}}canique type "Biarez-Favre", que pour un sol et un {\'{e}}tat hydrique donn{\'{e}}, il existe une relation biunivoque entre la densit{\'{e}} s{\`{e}}che (d) et la r{\'{e}}sistance de pointe (qd). Cette relation est repr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}e au moyen d'une courbe d{\'{e}}finie par l'expression logarithmique (d) = A * (1/w) +B*ln (qd) +C. Les valeurs de A, B et C repr{\'{e}}sentent les constantes de r{\'{e}}gression de cette relation. En suivant les m{\^{e}}mes hypoth{\`{e}}ses que (Chaigneau, 2001) et en s'appuyant sur les travaux de Biarez et Favre, on admet que les param{\`{e}}tres A, B et C sont fonction des propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}s physiques, d'{\'{e}}tat et d'interaction des sols. L'objectif de ce travail est de d{\'{e}}velopper un mod{\`{e}}le math{\'{e}}matique permettant de trouver les relations qui lient les constantes de r{\'{e}}gression A, B et C aux caract{\'{e}}ristiques granulom{\'{e}}triques, d'{\'{e}}tat, hydrique et plastique du sol. Pour ce faire, cette {\'{e}}tude s'appuie sur une base de donn{\'{e}}es (BDD) compos{\'{e}}e de divers types de sols, pour lesquels on dispose des courbes de calibration pour diff{\'{e}}rents degr{\'{e}}s de compactage et d'humidit{\'{e}}. Ce travail a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}} en 4 phases, int{\'{e}}grant quelques concepts statistiques, math{\'{e}}matiques et des notions de base de la m{\'{e}}canique de sols. Dans un premier temps un {\'{e}}tat de l'art est pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}} concernant les sols et leurs propri{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}s physiques, d'{\'{e}}tat et d'interaction. En deuxi{\`{e}}me temps, la BDD, outil principal de ce travail, est pass{\'{e}}e en revue et compl{\'{e}}t{\'{e}}e. Par la suite on {\'{e}}tudie par le biais de l'{\'{e}}tablissement de matrices de corr{\'{e}}lations les relations pouvant exister entre les valeurs A, B et C et les param{\`{e}}tres caract{\'{e}}ristiques des sols de la BDD. La validation des mod{\`{e}}les propos{\'{e}}s est r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}}e exp{\'{e}}rimentalement pour de sols appartenant {\`{a}} la BDD, mais aussi pour de nouveaux sols. Une comparaison des courbes de calibration mesur{\'{e}}es au laboratoire et celles estim{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} partir des mod{\`{e}}les pr{\'{e}}sent{\'{e}}s est ainsi effectu{\'{e}}e. Les r{\'{e}}sultats de ce travail permettront de d{\'{e}}terminer, {\`{a}} partir de param{\`{e}}tres facilement identifiables au laboratoire (granulom{\'{e}}trie, plasticit{\'{e}}, teneur eau {\ldots}), les constantes de r{\'{e}}gression A, B et C pour tout sol non inclus dans la BDD originellement d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}}e par (Chaigneau, 2001).

Un mod{\`{e}}le n'est pas seulement une s{\'{e}}rie d'{\'{e}}quations repr{\'{e}}sentant le comportement physique ou m{\'{e}}canique du sol, c'est aussi une repr{\'{e}}sentation g{\'{e}}om{\'{e}}trique de l'espace, qui d{\'{e}}limite les couches ou volumes occup{\'{e}}s par chaque mat{\'{e}}riau (sol, roche, eau, b{\'{e}}ton, m{\'{e}}tal, g{\'{e}}osynth{\'{e}}tiques, etc.) et pr{\'{e}}cise la place des conditions aux limites et des interfaces, avec leurs conditions de contact. Les mod{\`{e}}les utilis{\'{e}}s dans les {\'{e}}tudes de m{\'{e}}canique des sols sont tr{\`{e}}s divers. Les m{\'{e}}thodes de calcul classiques admettent en g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ral des g{\'{e}}om{\'{e}}tries simplifi{\'{e}}es (couche de sol homog{\`{e}}ne, massif semi-infini) et r{\'{e}}duisent souvent le comportement du sol {\`{a}} des relations unidimensionnelles (th{\'{e}}orie de la consolidation) ou bidimensionnelles planes (calculs de stabilit{\'{e}} de pente, sout{\`{e}}nements) ou axisym{\'{e}}triques (r{\'{e}}seaux de drains ou de colonnes, pieux, galeries de tunnels). Les calculs tridimensionnels sont limit{\'{e}}s aux {\'{e}}quations de l'{\'{e}}lasticit{\'{e}} lin{\'{e}}aire pour les fondations superficielles et {\`{a}} certaines {\'{e}}tudes d'{\'{e}}coulements. Les relations entre les forces ou contraintes et les d{\'{e}}placements ou d{\'{e}}formations sont souvent lin{\'{e}}aires et isotropes pour les calculs de d{\'{e}}formations, et de type rigide-plastique pour les calculs de stabilit{\'{e}}. Les progr{\`{e}}s des ordinateurs et des m{\'{e}}thodes d'analyse num{\'{e}}rique permettent de d{\'{e}}passer les limitations g{\'{e}}om{\'{e}}triques et rh{\'{e}}ologiques des m{\'{e}}thodes de calcul traditionnelles et d'aborder l'{\'{e}}tude de probl{\`{e}}mes aux g{\'{e}}om{\'{e}}tries et lois de comportement complexes, combinant les concepts classiques de compressibilit{\'{e}}, de consolidation primaire et de compression secondaire, de r{\'{e}}sistance au cisaillement, d'{\'{e}}tats limites de pouss{\'{e}}e-but{\'{e}}e ou de portance. Cette approche globale passe par la d{\'{e}}finition d'une loi de comportement sp{\'{e}}cifique {\`{a}} chaque type de sol et par l'utilisation de techniques num{\'{e}}riques appropri{\'{e}}es.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Australian Geomechanics Society. The assessment of rate effects on piezocone test in tailings is a necessary step in the design of tailings storage facilities, since these geomaterials often exhibit coefficients of hydraulic conductivity in the range of transitional soils. The present paper describes the application of a non-linear poroelastic model conceived to capture the transient flow effects of the soil around an expanding cylinder (Dienstmann et al, 2015), to the interpretation of piezocone tests in gold tailings. Tests carried out at constant penetration rates ranging from 0.3mm/s to 57 mm/s are used in the analysis. Results are interpreted in a space that correlates dimensionless velocity V h to cone resistance Q and degree of drainage U showing that penetration is essentially drained at normalized velocities less than about 0.1 and essentially undrained at normalized velocities greater than 10.},

abstract = {When using a classical SHPB (Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar) set-up, the useful measuring time is limited by the need of separating the waves propagating in opposite directions. A new method for separating and rebuilding waves in finite bars was developed, with no time limit, from N strain measurements and P particle velocity measurements (N + P ≥ 2). It takes account of the wave dispersion in elastic and viscoelastic bars. The method is illustrated with the loading of a free bar where the measured displacement is 30 times longer than the displacement that would be obtained with the classical method. {\textcopyright} 2001 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences/{\'{e}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.},

abstract = {The Standard Penetration Test (SPT) is the most popular example of dynamic probing, a large category of soil testing techniques. Understanding and interpretation of these tests is hampered by the difficulties of reproducing them under controlled laboratory conditions. The virtual calibration chamber technique, based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM), may supplement or substitute this complex experimentation. In this paper SPT in sand are analyzed considering the energy transfer involved. Energy balances are written for the penetrating rod and for the material in the chamber. All the terms are computed for a number of cases in which the main variables controlling test response in the field -initial density and stress level- are systematically varied. The analysis confirms previous field observations indicating that, when an energy-based interpretation is used, SPT provides a value of equivalent penetration resistance that is the same that would be obtained with a static cone penetration test. The analyses also provide an unequivocal explanation for this observation: although the impacting rod shows complicated dynamics the response of the sand is quasi-static.},

The field study included stress - and penetration rate-controlled tests, performed with an electric penetrometer, as well as several short-term and stage-loaded pressuremeter tests. The study shows that a static penetration tests can furnish valuable information on the time-dependent strength of frozen soil, provided the test is conducted either with a very accurate control of the peneration rate, or as a stage-loaded test. An attempt was made to find a relationship between the penetration rate and an equivalent time to failure for the soil surrounding the penetrometer tip. Refs.},

abstract = {Driving energy was measured in a standard penetration test (SPT) and 12 types of dynamic cone penetration tests (DCPTs) having different configurations for the hammer, driving rod, anvil and cone tip. The driving energy transferred from the free falling hammer to the driving rod was estimated from the measurements of strain and acceleration below the anvil. Basically, the driving energy was estimated for 21 successive blows in order to obtain the mean value, the standard deviation ($\sigma$) and the coefficient of variance (COV) in the SPT and DCPTs. The dynamic cone resistance, qdyn, was estimated from the driving energy, the corresponding set per blow, and masses of the hammer and the total rods. Thus, the estimated dynamic cone resistance was compared with the static cone resistance, qt, from a cone penetration test (CPT). The main objective of this report is to provide information on the driving efficiency in the SPT and each DCPT. The mean values for ef in the tests ranged from 52{\%} to 76{\%}. The values of COV for ef ranged from 0.024 to 0.265. Even though the test results are limited, the dynamic cone resistance, qt, estimated from the dynamic measurements were relatively good measures of the cone resistance from the CPT, showing the importance of the dynamic measurement in the SPT and DCPTs. In addition, possible factors influencing the driving efficiency, such as the hammer mass, the configuration of the driving rod (solid or hollow), the ratio of the diameter of the anvil and the diameter of the hammer, and the existence of a cushion or cushions between the anvil and the hammer, are discussed on the basis of the limited test results.},

abstract = {Finite element analyses with a two-surface-plasticity constitutive model and calibration chamber tests with DIC technique are used to investigate the response of non-displacement piles and pile groups to static axial load. The study shows that the mobilized coefficient of lateral earth pressure K increases with increasing relative density D R in sand but deceases with increasing depth (and the resulting greater initial vertical effective stress ' v0). Due to scale effects, a model-size pile develops a much greater unit shaft resistance than a prototype pile under similar conditions. The surface roughness of the piles has a significant impact on the mobilization of shear band and shaft resistance along the pile shaft: up to a threshold value, a greater pile surface roughness generates a thicker shear band and greater unit shaft resistance. Three-dimensional FE analyses on non-displacement pile groups reveals that the interactions between piles in a small pile group are minimal due to strain localization near the piles, and the group efficiency is almost unity at the ultimate load level.},

A macro-element approach is used to represent a rod driven with an impact like those applied to perform SPT. The rod is driven into a chamber filled with a scaled discrete analogue of a quartz sand. The contact properties of the discrete analogue are calibrated simulating two low-pressure triaxial tests. The rod is driven changing input energy and controlling initial density and confinement stress. Energy-based blowcount normalization is shown to be effective. Results obtained are in good quantitative agreement with well-accepted experimentally-based relations between blowcount, density and overburden. It is also shown that the tip resistance measured under impact dynamic penetration conditions is close to that under constant velocity conditions, hence supporting recent proposals to relate CPT and SPT results.},

En effet, nonlin{\'{e}}arit{\'{e}}, non-r{\'{e}}versibilit{\'{e}}, dila-tance, effet du temps, anisotropie sont autant de caract{\'{e}}ristiques du comportement du squelette des sols, auquel il faut adjoindre le couplage avec la pression interstitielle pour les sols fins satur{\'{e}}s. Sujet n{\'{e}}cessaire car, devant cette complexit{\'{e}}, il convient d'avoir une approche pragmatique et r{\'{e}}a-liste pour dimensionner les ouwages g{\'{e}}otechniques. Apr{\`{e}}s le d{\'{e}}veloppement de mod{\`{e}}les de compor-tement g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}ral du sol comportant un grand nombre de param{\`{e}}tres et qui s'est heurt{\'{e}} au probl{\`{e}}me de leur d{\'{e}}termination et de leut mesure, ce sont maintenant des mod{\`{e}}les plus simples, souvent de type {\'{e}}lastoplastique, voire m{\^{e}}me {\'{e}}lastique, qui sont utilis{\'{e}}s, mais dans lesquels le module de d{\'{e}}formation pris en compte est adapt{\'{e}} au type de sollicitation propre {\`{a}} l'ouwage consid{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}. Ainsi, pour un sol donn{\'{e}}, il n'y a pas un seul module, mais un grand nombre de moduies. Reste {\`{a}} choisir celui qui est le plus appropri{\'{e}} et pour ce faire, les retours d'exp{\'{e}}rience et les r{\'{e}}sultats d'instrumentations sont d'une importance capitale. Olivier Combarieu a pass{\'{e}} toute sa carri{\`{e}}re de g{\'{e}}otechnicien au laboratoire r{\'{e}}gional des Ponts et Chauss{\'{e}}es de Rouen du CETE de Normandie Centre. Il nous liwe ici son exp{\'{e}}rience, riche d'une grande diversit{\'{e}} d'ouwages dimensionn{\'{e}}s et de nombreuses recherches effectu{\'{e}}es, {\`{a}} propos notamment du pressiom{\`{e}}tre dont il faut rappeler qu'il est le seul essai rn situ courant qui donne un module de d{\'{e}}for-mation du sol. Apr{\`{e}}s avoir indiqu{\'{e}} les diff{\'{e}}rents modules que l'on peut tirer de l'essai pressiom{\'{e}}trique, il pr{\'{e}}sente une analyse critique et argument{\'{e}}e de leur utilisation possible dans deux domaines o{\`{u}} le choix du module de d{\'{e}}formation est capital: les tassements des fondations superficielles, puis les d{\'{e}}pla-cements lat{\'{e}}raux des parois souples et des pieux. Ses connaissances pratiques approfondies lui per-mettent d'apporter sur certains points un {\'{e}}clairage neuf, de bien montrer la compl{\'{e}}mentarit{\'{e}} existant entre essai aedom{\'{e}}trique et essai pressiom{\'{e}}trique; elles l'am{\`{e}}nent m{\^{e}}me {\`{a}} r{\'{e}}futer certaines pratiques erron{\'{e}}es pour recommander des m{\'{e}}thodes plus adapt{\'{e}}es, particuli{\`{e}}rement pour les charges de tr{\`{e}}s grandes dimensions sur sols compressibles. L'article ne comporte ni de longs calculs, ni de grandes th{\'{e}}ories. Nul doute qu'il sera appr{\'{e}}ci{\'{e}} de tous ceux qui, de pr{\`{e}}s ou de loin, s'int{\'{e}}ressent au calcul en d{\'{e}}formation des ouwages g{\'{e}}otechniques. l.Sl IE l= I rrl l.Ol l{\'{E}} Fran{\c{c}}ois SCHLOSSER L'auteur examine en d{\'{e}}tail la notion de module et l'usage qui en est fait dans le g{\'{e}}nie civil et tout particuli{\`{e}}rement en g{\'{e}}otechnique. Apr{\`{e}}s un rappel {\'{e}}l{\'{e}}mentaire du comportement {\'{e}}lastique et des essais initiaux en ayant permis l'{\'{e}}tude, la r{\'{e}}alit{\'{e}} du comportement est d{\'{e}}crite dans les deux domaines: celui du cisaillement (ou d{\'{e}}viatorique), et celui de la compression (ou sph{\'{e}}rique) dans les conditions de drainage ou non-drainage du sol. Les diff{\'{e}}rents essais d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}}s pour caract{\'{e}}riser les massifs sont d{\'{e}}crits, de m{\^{e}}me que les liens existant entre les divers param{\`{e}}tres de d{\'{e}}formation en r{\'{e}}sultant. Trois tylres de probl{\`{e}}mes tr{\`{e}}s courants sont ensuite expos{\'{e}}s, arrxquels l'auteur a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} confront{\'{e}}. 1) Tout d'abord, celui des tassements verticaux sous fondations superficielles et sous charge de tr{\`{e}}s grande dimension. Est r{\'{e}}affirm{\'{e}}e la pertinence, pour les sols peu compressibles, de l'approche pressiom{\'{e}}trique pour les fondations superficielles de dimensions transversales mod{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}es, de m{\^{e}}me que celle d'une approche {\'{e}}lastique {\`{a}} partir du module cyclique issu de l'essai pressiom{\'{e}}trique. Il est propos{\'{e}} un facteur correctif, non valid{\'{e}}, dans I'approche {\'{e}}lastique lorsque les dimensions, {\`{a}} la fois transversale et longitudinale, deviennent importantes. 2) Puis, celui des tassements des sols compressibles sous charges de tr{\`{e}}s grande {\'{e}}tendue o{\`{u}} l'approche pressiom{\'{e}}trique s'av{\`{e}}re inadapt{\'{e}}e et optimiste, ainsi que source possible d'erreurs graves, m{\^{e}}me si l'on propose d'en am{\'{e}}liorer la formulation.

abstract = {This paper presents results from a numerical study performed to examine cone penetration response that spans fully undrained to fully drained conditions. Coupled-consolidation finite-element analyses, which accounted for large deformation and finite sliding effects, were carried out using Abaqus/Standard v6.6 at various rates of cone penetration. The model assumed a smooth soil/cone interface, with the soil idealised as a homogeneous elastic-perfectly plastic material obeying a nondilatant Drucker-Prager yield criterion. The results for the limiting undrained and drained conditions are compared with published strain path and cone factor solutions. The significant advance of this work is the establishment of the theoretical backbone curves arising from the effects of partial consolidation during cone penetration. The factors affecting the backbone curves are examined, and a simplified procedure for deriving these curves is proposed using a hyperbolic fit. An example is then presented to illustrate how the data from measured field cone tests performed at different penetration rates may be used to estimate the strength, deformation and consolidation characteristics of a soil.},

abstract = {The opinionated text available on the Internet and Web 2.0 social media has created ample research opportunities related to mining and analyzing public sentiments. At the same time, the large volume of such data poses severe data processing and sentiment extraction related challenges. Different contemporary solutions based on machine learning, dictionary, statistical, and semantic based approaches have been proposed in literature for sentiment analysis of online user-generated data. Recent research studies have proved that supervised machine learning techniques like Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are very effective for sentiment based classification of opinionated text. This paper proposes a hybrid sentiment classification model based on Boosted SVM. The proposed model exploits classification performance of two techniques (Boosting and SVM) applied for the task of sentiment based classification of online reviews. The results on movies and hotel review corpora of 2000 reviews have shown that the proposed approach has succeeded in improving performance of SVM when used as a weak learner for sentiment based classification. Specifically, the results show that SVM ensemble with bagging or boosting significantly outperforms a single SVM in terms of accuracy of sentiment based classification.},

abstract = {Firstly, the historical background is presented for the determination of ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations. The principles of plastic equilibrium used in the classical formulation of the ultimate bearing capacity are reviewed, followed by a discussion about the sources of approximations inherent in the classical theory. Secondly, based on a variety of case histories of site investigations, including extensive bore hole data, laboratory testing and geophysical prospecting, an empirical formulation is proposed for the determi- nation of allowable bearing capacity of shallow foundations. The proposed expression cor- roborates consistently with the results of the classical theory and is proven to be reliable and safe, also from the view point of maximum allowable settlements. It consists of only two soil parameters, namely, the in-situ measured shear wave velocity, and the unit weight. The unit weight may be also determined with sufficient accuracy, by means of another empirical expression, using the P-wave velocity. It is indicated that once the shear and P-wave velocities are measured in-situ by an appropriate geophysical survey, the allowable bearing capacity is determined reliably through a single step operation. Such an approach, is considerably cost and time-saving, in practice.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that so-called heterogeneous granular materials are frequently employed in civil engineering applications, their mechanical behavior has only been examined in a few comprehensive studies, whether this be experimentally or numerically. This lack of preliminary investigation could prove problematic especially when it comes to structural design. A two-dimensional, discrete element numerical model has been implemented in order to carry out a systematic study of various types of granular assemblies; this set-up will be composed of two particle families, either in variable proportions or with a relatively tighter particle size distribution. The microstructure of granular assemblies submitted to isotropic confinement has been described in terms of porosity and granular arrangement, and the mechanical behavior of such assemblies was obtained by exposure to biaxial loading. The main parameters studied herein are: the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for elastic characteristics, macromechanical angles of friction at both the peak state and within the domain of large deformations, as well as dilatancy using volumetric variation curves vs. axial deformation.},

abstract = {The use of soil stabilization in place of cutting out and replacing the existing subgrade soil can save significant amounts of resources in roadway construction projects. Also, the possibility of stabilizing a low-grade soil using by-products is economically and environmentally attractive. Considering that, the main objective of this study is to show the technical feasibility of using desulfurization steel slag from the Kambara reactor process (KR slag) as a soil stabilizer. A total of nine soil mixes were evaluated in the laboratory, varying the type of soil and the percentage and type of additives (KR slag and portland cement) used. After laboratory evaluation, two field sections were constructed. The trial sections were subject to repetitive traffic loading using a heavy-vehicle simulator (HVS). Weekly measurements were taken according to the following tests: Benkelman beam, British portable tester, and rutting depth measurements. The soil-KR mix designed with 20{\%} KR slag addition and a poor-grade soil (clay) performed as well as the typical soil modified by cement solution designed with a better-quality soil (sand) modified by 3{\%} cement. The clay soil did not meet standard requirements even when mixed with 10{\%} portland cement. However, the clay soil modified by KR slag not only presented satisfactory laboratory results for roadway use in the base and/or subbase utilization, it also showed excellent field performance.},

abstract = {The traditional dynamic load test, based on the one-dimensional wave propagation theory consists in applying a sequence of constant energy blows and making measurements using deformation and acceleration sensors installed on top of the pile, as a function of time. The traditional method has evolved with the development of a numerical model that simulates the Static Load Test (SLT) of a pile dynamically tested. Another evolution was the introduction of the Dynamic Increasing Energy Test (DIET) created and proposed by Aoki (1997). The present study is an initiative to deepen the increasing energy method focusing on the definition of the maximum lateral resistance envelope, allowing the recovery of the mobilized resistance along the shaft, lost in blows prior to the maximum applied energy, especially in layers close to the top of the pile. This procedure is called the Maximum Envelope of Lateral Resistance. Two case studies are presented, in which static and dynamic tests were performed on the same pile. The application of the Maximum Envelope of Lateral Resistance, also referred to as Maximum Envelope Method, led to a definition of higher load capacities through the CAPWAP analysis, with simulated load-displacement curves with good correlations in comparison with the Static Load Tests (SLT). When performed after several rest periods, the Maximum Envelope Method allows an assessment of the “set up” development over time.},

abstract = {The behaviour of pile foundations for offshore wind turbines deviates from classical assumptions and accumulated experience mainly due to their large diameter, reduced slenderness and elevated ratio of lateral to vertical loads. The offshore environment poses the additional challenge of large numbers of load cycles from wind and waves and the possible influence of transient changes of pore water pressure around the pile, both of them issues that are still not well understood and also not being contemplated in current design guidelines. In saturated soils, short-term cyclic loading within the extreme regime often involves a porepressure build up that eventually can lead to liquefaction phenomena and foundation failure. On the other hand, the effects of the long-term cyclic loading on the foundation's stability and especially on its serviceability must also be studied. The purpose of this work was to gain an insight into both aspects, while developing a practicable numerical tool for a short-term prognosis and deriving useful criteria for design. To achieve such goals, the investigations have been broadly divided into a first part with a theoretical orientation for the analysis of short-term transient effects in the frame of the Finite Element Method, and a second empirical block for the study of long-term phenomena by means of model tests in a reduced scale. The general picture that arises from these investigations is that of a foundation subject to hardening and soil densification in the long term, but also affected by transient episodes of significant softening during the storms as a consequence of pore pressure accumulation. Hence the importance of considering the coupling effects between soil stress and pore water pressure in design, even for those cases where a soil liquefaction could in principle be disregarded on the grounds of a high relative density of the soil. For practical design purposes, it seems sensible to distinguish between piles in fully drained conditions, in partially drained conditions and in undrained conditions, and analyse them correspondingly employing different strategies. Some considerations in this respect have been given in the final sections of this thesis.},

abstract = {The purpose of this master thesis is to evaluate the results from the completed SCPT (Seismic Cone Penetration Test) surveys with respect to the methods ability to estimate dynamic young´s modulus. This has been done by comparing the result from SCPT to other seismic methods and dynamic parameters converted from “static” geotechnical surveys. SCPT is a relatively new method which has not been used by Sweco or in Sweden to any greater extent and is therefore of interest to be looked in to. By adding two geophones to an ordinary CPT (Cone Penetration Test) equipment as well as including strike plates, hammer and logger system one can log dynamic parameters in addition to the regular parameters logged by a CPT system. This is done by stopping the otherwise continuous CPT survey every meter and striking the strike plates, which are placed under the tracks of the drilling rig. Seismic waves will then travel through the soil down to the geophones and be used to calculate dynamic parameters. For this master thesis a total of 47 geotechnical and geophysical surveys have been considered. The location of these 47 are approximately 7 km north of Norrk{\"{o}}ping and have been conducted between the years 2016-2017 for the East Link Project. The geotechnical surveys are composed of weight-sounding, ram-sounding and CPT while the geophysical ones are SCPT, refraction-survey and MASW (Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves). Static elastic parameters have been calculated using the geotechnical survey results according to the Swedish transportation administrations standardized methods. These have then been converted to dynamic parameters with the help of different relationships. When these have been converted they can be compared to SCPT results and other seismic survey methods which also use wave velocity, Poisson's ratio and density to calculate dynamic elastic parameters. Based on the results from this thesis it can be concluded that the seismic test add-on to a standard CPTu survey is a good method for accessing dynamic modules and it gives extended information of the soil stratigraphy from one single survey point. After the studies and analyses conducted for this thesis it can be concluded that the proposed conversion between static and dynamic young's modulus using the Alpan curve gives slightly higher values than the ones derived directly from shear waves using SCPT. The other conversion using cone tip resistance to shear wave velocity gives on the other hand slightly lower values than the ones measured with the SCPT. The analysis also indicate similar trends in results between the different seismic methods. These results does however also shows that the used assumptions are somewhat general for accurate comparisons between the methods.},

@article{Zheng2012,
abstract = {As shown in the extensive studies of the dynamic responses of cellular materials, when the impact velocity is high, 'shock' waves can be generated. Because of the nature of the cellular structure, behind the 'shock (or compaction) front', there is a region of thickness approximately one single-cell-layer, across which the deformation can vary enormously, with strains of the order of ∼0.8, say. This is due to the extensive and progressive crushing of the cells. The compressed part of the cellular material is crushed and densified as the material crosses the front. Depending on the details of the cellular geometry, this locally large deformation can be very intricate to model, however, a first order 'shock' model can be defined, which permits a useful understanding of the phenomenology of the dynamic deformation of cellular materials, particularly metal foams. However, when the impact velocity is not very high, there exists a different type of front behind which the strain, though plastic, does not reach the densification strain. Based on one-dimensional continuum-based stress wave theory with a 'rigid unloading' assumption, in this paper a theoretical framework is established to explore the corresponding inherent mechanisms as a simple extension of the original 'shock' theory. Two models, namely the Shock-Mode model and the Transitional-Mode model, are introduced. The distributions of stress, strain and velocity in the foam rod are derived. The theoretical results show that for a Shock Mode, behind the front the initial strain remains constant and the initial stress varies proportionally with the square of the impact velocity, but for a Transition Mode, the initial strain and stress behind the front reduce linearly with reducing impact velocity. The critical impact velocities for modes transition are predicted. Two dimensionless parameters, namely the shock-enhancement parameter and the stress-hardening parameter, are defined and the features of the theoretical predictions are presented. Compared to the experimental results, the responses at the ends of foam rod are well predicted by the present models and also by the R-P-P-L model. However, deformation mechanisms uncovered by the present modes and the R-P-P-L model are very different when the impact velocity is not very high. The present simple, wave-based models extend the understanding of metallic foams to loading over a wider range of impact velocities than the previous models. In particular, the sub-shock-like behaviour, which has not yet been dealt within the literature, can be better understood through the new Transitional-Mode model. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This project presents pavement treatment practice guidelines and a distress identification manual for the purpose of improving the INDOT pavement preservation practices. The treatment guidelines consist of 10 treatment types for asphalt pavements and composite pavements and 8 treatment types for Portland cement concrete pavement (PCCP). The treatment guidelines include treatment descriptions, benefits, applicable pavement conditions, treatment materials, and treatment procedures. The guidelines are based on information obtained mainly from the INDOT Standard Specification, the INDOT Design Manual, and the INDOT Field Operations Handbook for Crew Leaders. The treatments are covered in the guidelines. The distress identification manual presents the different types of distresses found on the surfaces of asphalt pavement, composite pavement, and PCCP. Each distress type in this manual is presented along with descriptions, causes, measurements, and pictures of each type of distress. The manual is mainly based on the Distress Identification Manual for the Long Term Pavement Performance Program (LTPP) and the INDOT Design Manual. To implement the guidelines and the manuals, training slides were developed and are enclosed in this report. The training slides were developed to address all topics of the pavement preservation treatment area and combine to make one set of training materials suitable for Indiana. The training slides for pavement preservation implementation can help to enhance the overall construction quality of treatments by illustrating the appropriate use of such treatments in applications, thereby contributing to their improved performance. This improvement will help to ensure that the treatments are used to their maximum benefit and efficiency. 17.},

On one hand, analytical solutions are developed for assessing the nonlinear axial dynamic response of the shaft of a pile subjected to dynamic loads, and in particular to vibratory loads. Radial inhomogeneity arising from shear modulus degradation is evaluated over a range of parameters and compared with those obtained by other authors and by a numerical radial discrete model simulating the pile and soil movements from integration of the laws of motion. New approximate non linear solutions for axial pile shaft behaviour developed from general elastodynamic equations are presented and compared to existing linear solutions. The soil non linear behaviour and its ability to dissipate mechanical energy upon cyclic loading are shown to have a significant influence on the mechanical impedance provided by the surrounding soil against pile shaft movement. The limitations of over-simplified modelling of pile response are highlighted.},

abstract = {The elastic behaviour of compacted soils subjected to very small strains (smaller than 10－5 )is essential,becausethe serviceability of most geotechnical structures depends on soil elastic properties. Small-strain sti{\v{S}}ness of soils was stud- ied in the past years using di{\v{S}}erent experimental devices (mainly resonant columns). However, the results have been relatively inconsistent. The bender elements technique, now extensively used in soil mechanics, o{\v{S}}ers an e‹cient non destructive alternative, since it is based on the propagation of shear waves. To enrich the common bender elements tes- ting results providing only shear modulus values, an evolution of the bender elements technique, named bender-exten- der element's is used in this paper. This device allows the simultaneous measurement of the shear and compression wave velocities. As a result, the two independent elastic constants are measured for the same sample in order to avoid indirect estimations. Also, for unconˆned sample's the GrindoSonic test is performed: this test is based on the tran- sient vibrational response of the sample to a slight shock. The present study provides new results about the elastic properties of intermediate unsaturated soils made of mixtures of sand and clay. The results for the elastic properties are presented as a function of the suction level. Finally, a model relating the elastic behaviour of these unsaturated soils is proposed. Key},

abstract = {Soil stress-strain behaviour is highly non-linear and this has an important influence on the selection of design parameters for simple routine geotechnical calculations. Non-linear behaviour can be characterized by rigidity and degree of non-linearity and these can be determined from measurements of very small strain-stiffness, peak strength and failure strain. Very small strain-stiffness can be found from measurements of shear wave velocity in situ or in laboratory tests. Peak strength and failure strain can be measured in routine laboratory tests but are strongly influenced by initiation of shear bands. The important non-linear stiffness parameters for soil are related to its composition and to its current state. Back-analyses of the load settlement behaviour of full-scale and model foundations demonstrate the influence of non-linear soil behaviour. Variations of stiffness with settlement calculated from full-scale and model foundations agree well with non-linear soil stiffnesses based on rigidity and degree of non-linearity. These results suggest a simple method for routine design which takes account of soil non-linear stiffness.},

This article capitalizes on the modeling capabilities of neural networks as substitutes for the classic approaches. The neural network-based modeling overcomes the difficulties encountered in understanding the underlying microscopic processes governing the material's behavior by redirecting the efforts into learning the cause-effect relations from behavioral examples. Several methodologies are presented and cross-compared for effectiveness in approximating a theoretical hysteresis model resembling stress-strain behavior. The most effective methodology was used in modeling the constitutive behavior of an experimentally tested soil and produced models that simulated the real behavior of the soil with high accuracy. Although these models are empirical, they are retrainable and thus, unlike classic constitutive modeling techniques, can be revised and generalized easily when new data become available.},

The paper presents an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite element method for plane and axisymmetric quasi-static penetration into sand which overcomes the problems associated with the classical approaches. An operator-split is applied which breaks up solution of the governing equations over a time step into a Lagrangian step, a mesh motion step, and a transport step. A unique feature of the ALE method is an advanced hypoplastic rate constitutive equation to realistically predict stress and density changes within the material even at large deformations. In addition, an efficient optimization-based algorithm has been implemented to smooth out the non-convexly distorted mesh regions that occur below a penetrator. Applications to shallow penetration and pile penetration are given which make use of the developments.},

abstract = {The virtual calibration chamber technique, based on the discrete element method, is here applied to study the standard penetration test (SPT). A macro-element approach is used to represent a rod driven with an impact like those applied to perform SPT. The rod is driven into a chamber filled with a scaled discrete analogue of a quartz sand. The contact properties of the discrete analogue are calibrated simulating two low-pressure triaxial tests. The rod is driven changing input energy and controlling initial density and confinement stress. Energy-based blowcount normalization is shown to be effective. Results obtained are in good quantitative agreement with well-accepted experimentally-based relations between blowcount, density and overburden. It is also shown that the tip resistance measured under impact dynamic penetration conditions is close to that under constant velocity conditions, hence supporting recent proposals to relate CPT and SPT results.},

@article{Niazi2019,
abstract = {Initiating at the small-strain shear modulus (Gmax), the mechanical nonlinear stress-strain-strength behavior of soil manifests in the form of modulus reduction, typically expressed in normalized form as Gop/Gmax. Here, Gop is the operative shear modulus – a reduced stiffness value corresponding to strain levels that the soil is experiencing. Assessment of Gop is critical to reliable predictions of load-related deformations within the soil. Among the various categories of loading, deep foundations and pilings exhibit a typical mechanism of axial load transfer to the foundation soil. For friction type piles, the stiffness reduction mostly takes place along the pile shaft-soil interface. Within the framework of an analytical solution, the back analyses from the results of load tests on pile foundations, together with the knowledge of pile geometries and soil parameters, provide an outline for evaluation of Gop at different load increments. This paper explains the methodology employed to develop stiffness reduction curves (Gop/Gmax) as a function of pseudo-strain ($\gamma$p = wt/d), where, wt = settlement at the pile top, and d = pile diameter. Algorithms that integrate the plasticity characteristics of the soil are also presented. The results afford an improved evaluation of the complete nonlinear load-settlement (Q-wt) response for pile foundations under axial loads.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of a so-called continuum numerical model for wave propagation analysis and soil-pile dynamic response during pile driving. An axisymmetric finite difference numerical model is developed having solid elements for both pile structure and the soil media surrounding and below the pile. Interface elements are used between the pile shaft and the soil to facilitate the sliding between the two media. The performance of the developed model is verified in two stages. First, a simple rod is subjected to a half sine-wave force function at the rod head and the corresponding reflections of force and velocity (multiplied by impedance) are presented for different boundary conditions at the rod tip. The model is then used for signal matching analysis of a real driven pile for which complete information of soil layering, dynamic test signals, and static load test results are available. The signal matching analysis was performed successfully and comparison between several other predicted and measured parameters proved the reasonably good performance of the developed continuum model. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Physical Society. We report continuous measurements of the sound velocity along the principal Hugoniot curve of $\alpha$ quartz between 0.25 and 1.45 TPa, as determined from lateral release waves intersecting the shock front as a function of time in decaying-shock experiments. The measured sound velocities are lower than predicted by prior models, based on the properties of stishovite at densities below ∼7 g/cm3, but agree with density functional theory molecular dynamics calculations and an empirical wide-regime equation of state presented here. The Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter calculated from the sound velocity decreases from $\gamma$∼1.3 at 0.25 TPa to 0.66 at 1.45 TPa. In combination with evidence for increased (configurational) specific heat and decreased bulk modulus, the values of $\gamma$ suggest a high thermal expansion coefficient at ∼0.25-0.65 TPa, where SiO2 is thought to be a bonded liquid. From our measurements, dissociation of the molecular bonds persists to ∼0.65-1.0 TPa, consistent with estimates by other methods. At higher densities, the sound velocity is close to predictions from previous models, and the Gr{\"{u}}neisen parameter approaches the ideal gas value.},

The size of the biases arising from these changes are estimated and their uncertainties evaluated. The estimated biases and their associated uncertainties are largest during the period immediately following the Second World War, reflecting the rapid and incompletely documented changes in shipping and data availability at the time. Adjustments have been applied to reduce these effects in gridded data sets of sea-surface temperature and the results are presented as a set of interchangeable realisations. Uncertainties of estimated trends in global-and regional-average sea-surface temperature due to bias adjustments since the Second World War are found to be larger than uncertainties arising from the choice of analysis technique, indicating that this is an important source of uncertainty in analyses of historical sea-surface temperatures. Despite this, trends over the twentieth century remain qualitatively consistent.},

abstract = {The right selection of soil model parameters is essential to make good predictions in geo-engineering projects where the Finite Element Method (FEM) is used. In order to support geotechnical engineers with soil model parameter selection, empirical formulas have been developed to derive the model parameters of the Plaxis Hardening Soil model with small-strain stiffness (HSsmall), on the basis of a characteristic property (relative density for sands and plasticity index for clays). This paper shows a validation of formulas for sands which have been derived from published soil testing data. The main goal of the empirical formulas is to give a reasonable first order approximation of soil behaviour in FEM calculations, covering a wide range of sands. In a case study it is demonstrated that the empirical formulas work reasonably well to get a first estimate of deformations and stress developments for a real project. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, London.},

Reference is also made to a website from which complete computer programs can be downloaded. Soil behaviour is usually assumed to be linear elastic, but in many cases the effect of viscous damping or hysteretic damping, due to plastic deformations, is also considered. Special features are: the analysis of wave propagation in saturated compressible porous media, approximate analysis of the generation of Rayleigh waves, the analysis of the response of soil layers to earthquakes in the deep rock, with a theoretical foundation of such problems by the propagation of Love waves, and the solution of such basic problems as the response of an elastic half space to point loads, line loads, strip loads and moving loads. - Includes detailed derivations of solutions - Includes listings of main parts of computer programs - Computer programs are available from the website http://geo.verruijt.net - Includes dynamics of porous media Audience: Students and staff in soil dynamics at civil engineering, geophysics and earthquake engineering departments.},

abstract = {Dyke's failure is a real problem that managers have to face. Failure cases are frequently observed, especially in developing countries. However, apart from simple visual inspections, the means of recognition of the hydraulic works are often heavy and expensive to apply. We propose by this work, an organization of methods and both original and economic techniques to help the manager to improve his knowledge about the park. The report is thus composed of three parts covering the general problems and two strong points of the diagnosis method suggested: ? the diagnosis method : an AMDE approach is presented, allowing the analysis of critical damages scenarios applied to a typical embankment model. The nature of degradations, their criticality and the observation scale condition the selected techniques as well as the organisation of the method (observation and temperature measures of the seeping water at the global scale, mechanical resistance at the scale of section and permeability at the scale of the soil layers), ? the estimation de mechanical stability : the purpose is to apply penetrometric techniques that are lights and economic in the aim to estimate the mechanical behaviour of a section. The use on embankments of these techniques is approached under a practical aspect (access, depth of investigation, surface layer{\ldots}) as well as theoretical (grid optimisation, estimation of the short term mechanical resistance in fine-grained saturated layers, spatialisation of the information). These techniques are completed by in situ permeability measurements ; for this a low scale perm{\'{e}}am{\`{e}}tre adapted to 4 cm² drillings is studied and developed. Laboratory and in situ measures, compared to a laboratory approach show the pertinence of this new equipment that allows the characterisation of soil layers and that delivers also an information about the average permeability of a section, ? the in situ estimation of the liquefaction potential and post-seismic resistance : we build a method derived from Robertson's, using point resistance and soil characterisation obtained from in situ permeability measures for estimating the liquefaction potential of soil. In addition, we are interested in post-seismic resistance of liquefiable materials ; for that, we carry out a serial of cyclic triaxial tests in the aim to obtain liquefied silt samples. These samples are then tested in compression. The correlation between post-cyclic resistance measures and point resistance before cycling leads to establish two criteria for evaluating post-seismic resistance in the case of this material. Each criterion is applied to a real case ; whatever the criterion, the embankment is likely to collapse under seismic conditions},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017. The recent technological developments made on the light dynamic penetration test Panda 3 {\textregistered} provide a dynamic load-penetration curve $\sigma$ p  - s p  for each impact. This curve is influenced by the mechanical and physical properties of the investigated granular media. In order to analyze and exploit the load-penetration curve, a numerical model of penetration test using 3D Discrete Element Method is proposed for reproducing tests in dynamic conditions in granular media. All parameters of impact used in this model have at first been calibrated by respecting mechanical and geometrical properties of the hammer and the rod. There is a good agreement between experimental results and the ones obtained from simulations in 2D or 3D. After creating a sample, we will simulate the Panda 3 {\textregistered}. It is possible to measure directly the dynamic load-penetration curve occurring at the tip for each impact. Using the force and acceleration measured in the top part of the rod, it is possible to separate the incident and reflected waves and then calculate the tip's load-penetration curve. The load-penetration curve obtained is qualitatively similar with that obtained by experimental tests. In addition, the frequency analysis of the measured signals present also a good compliance with that measured in reality when the tip resistance is qualitatively similar.},

Cependant, les p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tres dynamiques restent des appareils rustiques et d'une technologie ancienne. De m{\^{e}}me, ces appareils fournissent tr{\`{e}}s peu d'information, notamment la r{\'{e}}sistance de pointe qd ; qui n'est pas un param{\`{e}}tre intrins{\`{e}}que du sol. Par ailleurs, le ph{\'{e}}nom{\`{e}}ne du battage reste toujours expliqu{\'{e}} par la th{\'{e}}orie de chocs de Newton, alors qu'on sait qu'il n'est pas un simple probl{\`{e}}me pouvant {\^{e}}tre expliqu{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'aide de cette th{\'{e}}orie. C'est pour r{\'{e}}pondre {\`{a}} ces besoins qu'il a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}} un nouveau p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre dynamique {\'{e}}quip{\'{e}} de diff{\'{e}}rents capteurs permettant, par le biais du traitement et de l'analyse des signaux enregistr{\'{e}}s lors d'un choc, d'obtenir les param{\`{e}}tres gouvernant le comportement « effort-d{\'{e}}formation » du sol pendant l'enfoncement de la pointe. Il s'agit du p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre Panda 3. Le principe de mesure est simple et consiste {\`{a}} enregistrer et {\`{a}} d{\'{e}}coupler les ondes cr{\'{e}}{\'{e}}es par l'impact du marteau sur la t{\^{e}}te de l'appareil et {\`{a}} calculer ensuite la force, l'acc{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}ration et la vitesse subies en pointe. Ceci nous permettre de tracer la courbe charge-enfoncement pour chaque coup fourni lors du battage. L'exploitation de cette courbe permet de d{\'{e}}terminer des param{\`{e}}tres de r{\'{e}}sistance (qd, qc) et de d{\'{e}}formation du sol tels que la c{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}rit{\'{e}} des ondes (Vp et Vs), le module p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}trique (Ep) et l'amortissement de Smith (Js). Des nombreux essais ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} fin de valider la faisabilit{\'{e}} de l'appareil ainsi que des r{\'{e}}sultats obtenus au laboratoire. Toutefois {\`{a}} l'heure actuelle des essais in-situ n'ont pas {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} tr{\`{e}}s exploit{\'{e}}s. En effet, le d{\'{e}}veloppement d'un nouvel appareillage comprend non seulement le montage de l'appareil en lui-m{\^{e}}me et l'{\'{e}}tude au laboratoire, mais aussi des {\'{e}}tudes pr{\'{e}}alables de faisabilit{\'{e}}, de validation et des propositions des modes op{\'{e}}ratoires in-situ. L'objectif de ce travail c'est ainsi de valider la pertinence in-situ de cet essai et de valider la coh{\'{e}}rence des r{\'{e}}sultats obtenus par le biais d'un comparatif avec d'autres essais. Pour ce faire nous avons r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}} des campagnes d'essai in-situ {\`{a}} l'aide du Panda 3 et des essais g{\'{e}}otechniques (CPT, DPT, PMT,{\ldots}) et g{\'{e}}ophysiques (MASW-2D,{\ldots}) sur divers chantiers et terrains.

abstract = {This paper presents a calculation method for obtaining the continuous variation in stress between the tip and the soil during dynamic penetration tests, particularly in the case of using the Panda 3{\textregistered} penetration testing device. The originality of the method is that the tip stress can be computed continuously throughout the driving process. For each impact of the hammer on the penetrometer, data are recorded by sensors located at the top of the apparatus. Then, the stress at the tip and the displacement of the apparatus are calculated with a method based on the propagation of waves in the device. A three-dimensional numerical model of the penetration test, based on the Panda 3{\textregistered} specifications and using the discrete element method (DEM), is proposed in this paper. The purpose of the simulations is to validate the calculation method by comparing the curves of the tip stress versus the penetration distance obtained in two different ways, the first being the distance directly observed at the tip and the second being the distance calculated from the data recorded at the top of the penetrometer, as with the experimental device. The entire apparatus is represented, including the hammer, the rod, and the tip, and is driven into the model soil. The calculation method is applied, and the results are compared to the actual response of the soil to the driving of the penetrometer directly at the tip, which can be obtained with the numerical model. The responses are found to be very similar, confirming the theoretical framework and its underlying assumptions. This method is applied to dynamic penetration tests and provides the opportunity to obtain mechanical parameters other than the tip resistance from the tests.},

abstract = {CAPWAP(R) Provides the most reliable means of analyzing dynamic pile top
force and velocity records from the Pile Analzer(R) (PDA). This is a
signal matching approach which requires that certain soil parameters are
adjusted until measured and calculated pile top variables reach a
reasonable match. The number of unknown soil parameters depends on the
depth of pile penetration and therefore the computational effort can be
appreciable if the pile is long. The process can be either done in an
interactive manner or automatically with great time savings. Current
practice requires that the automatic results are checked by interactive
analysis.
In an attempt to make the automatic solution reliable, several
additional matching parameters have been included in the CAPWAP model.
Among these variables, the most important is the final set (inverse of
blow count) of the hammer blow analyzed. Unfortunately, since restrike
data is usually analyzed by CAPWAP for long term static capacity
predictions, final set is not always accurately known. For this reason a
study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of the automated CAPWAP
results including blow count matching compared to the traditional
approach. More than 30 cases where static load tests and restrike tests
had been performed were analyzed using the automatic procedure provided
by the Windows based CAPWAP Version 1999-1. This program also calculates
the total dynamic resistance (the sum of damping and static resistance)
allowing for an assessment of the ratio of total dynamic resistance to
static resistance and its relationship with soil type.},

abstract = {En reconnaissance g{\'{e}}otechnique, une des techniques le plus utilis{\'{e}}es dans le monde est tr{\`{e}}s certainement le p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre, et parmi eux, le p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre dynamique occupe une place tr{\`{e}}s importante. Cependant, les p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tres dynamiques restent des appareils rustiques et d'une technologie ancienne. De m{\^{e}}me, ces appareils fournissent tr{\`{e}}s peu d'information, notamment la r{\'{e}}sistance de pointe qd ; qui n'est pas un param{\`{e}}tre intrins{\`{e}}que du sol. Par ailleurs, le ph{\'{e}}nom{\`{e}}ne du battage reste toujours expliqu{\'{e}} par la th{\'{e}}orie de chocs de Newton, alors qu'on sait qu'il n'est pas un simple probl{\`{e}}me pouvant {\^{e}}tre expliqu{\'{e}} {\`{a}} l'aide de cette th{\'{e}}orie. C'est pour r{\'{e}}pondre {\`{a}} ces besoins qu'il a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} d{\'{e}}velopp{\'{e}} un nouveau p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre dynamique {\'{e}}quip{\'{e}} de diff{\'{e}}rents capteurs permettant, par le biais du traitement et de l'analyse des signaux enregistr{\'{e}}s lors d'un choc, d'obtenir les param{\`{e}}tres gouvernant le comportement « effort-d{\'{e}}formation » du sol pendant l'enfoncement de la pointe. Il s'agit du p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}tre Panda 3. Le principe de mesure est simple et consiste {\`{a}} enregistrer et {\`{a}} d{\'{e}}coupler les ondes cr{\'{e}}{\'{e}}es par l'impact du marteau sur la t{\^{e}}te de l'appareil et {\`{a}} calculer ensuite la force, l'acc{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}ration et la vitesse subies en pointe. Ceci nous permettre de tracer la courbe charge-enfoncement pour chaque coup fourni lors du battage. L'exploitation de cette courbe permet de d{\'{e}}terminer des param{\`{e}}tres de r{\'{e}}sistance (qd, qc) et de d{\'{e}}formation du sol tels que la c{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}rit{\'{e}} des ondes (Vp et Vs), le module p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}trique (Ep) et l'amortissement de Smith (Js). Des nombreux essais ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} fin de valider la faisabilit{\'{e}} de l'appareil ainsi que des r{\'{e}}sultats obtenus au laboratoire. Toutefois {\`{a}} l'heure actuelle des essais in-situ n'ont pas {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} tr{\`{e}}s exploit{\'{e}}s. En effet, le d{\'{e}}veloppement d'un nouvel appareillage comprend non seulement le montage de l'appareil en lui-m{\^{e}}me et l'{\'{e}}tude au laboratoire, mais aussi des {\'{e}}tudes pr{\'{e}}alables de faisabilit{\'{e}}, de validation et des propositions des modes op{\'{e}}ratoires in-situ. L'objectif de ce travail c'est ainsi de valider la pertinence in-situ de cet essai et de valider la coh{\'{e}}rence des r{\'{e}}sultats obtenus par le biais d'un comparatif avec d'autres essais. Pour ce faire nous avons r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}} des campagnes d'essai in-situ {\`{a}} l'aide du Panda 3 et des essais g{\'{e}}otechniques (CPT, DPT, PMT,{\ldots}) et g{\'{e}}ophysiques (MASW-2D,{\ldots}) sur divers chantiers et terrains. Par ailleurs, pour compl{\'{e}}ter cette {\'{e}}tude nous proposons une relation entre le terme de pointe qd et la densit{\'{e}} s{\`{e}}che, obtenue {\`{a}} partir des {\'{e}}tudes de calibration p{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}trom{\`{e}}trique r{\'{e}}alis{\'{e}}s sur la base des donn{\'{e}}es physiques des sols appartenant {\`{a}} Polytech' Clermont-Ferrand. Cela nous permettra de compl{\'{e}}ter l'information obtenue par le Panda 3. Enfin, un analyse des param{\`{e}}tres Panda 3 (r{\'{e}}sistance et d{\'{e}}formation) est {\'{e}}galement propos{\'{e}}e afin d'identifier le param{\`{e}}tre rh{\'{e}}ologique « alpha » propos{\'{e}} par Sanglerat, nous permettant de caract{\'{e}}riser la nature des sols in-situ.
